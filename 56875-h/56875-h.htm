  <h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a time when prejudiced historical verdicts are being
largely revised, and when it is universally admitted
that history must be studied on broader and more
discriminating lines than heretofore, the restatement
of the case for our first Queen Regnant scarcely
needs an apology.</p>

<p>Two books, one <i>The Privy Purse Expenses of the
Princess Mary</i>, with an Introductory Memoir by Sir
Frederick Madden, some time Keeper of the Manuscripts
in the British Museum, and the other, <i>The Life
of Jane Dormer, Duchess of Feria</i>, edited by the Rev.
Joseph Stevenson, from the original manuscript in
the possession of Lord Dormer, first revealed Queen
Mary to me as an attractive and sympathetic personality.
Subsequent diligent examination of documents
relating to her life and reign, scattered about
the various archives of Europe, has not belied that
impression, but has further shown that more interest
attaches to her dire struggle with the difficulties which
beset her than has generally been supposed.</p>

<p>This material has proved to be extremely rich and
abundant, especially as regards the archives of Venice,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Austria, Belgium and England. The valuable papers
formerly at Brussels have, it is true, disappeared, but
fortunately we are provided with transcripts of them
in the Record Office. And where the despatches of
ambassadors, those of Giustinian, Chapuys, Renard,
Michiel, de Noailles, Surian and others, drop the thread
of the story, our own chroniclers, Stowe, Holinshed,
Machyn, Wriothesley, Foxe, etc., take it up, so that
an almost continuous narrative is formed, reaching
from Mary’s earliest childhood to her death.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured, where possible, to give the
story in the words of each individual ambassador or
annalist, in order to preserve, if it might be, the atmosphere
of the times, in a manner unattainable by our
modern phraseology. In most instances, I have been
careful to reproduce even the eccentricities of the
spelling in the English documents quoted, but in
others, where I have given somewhat lengthy extracts
from our chroniclers, the spelling has been modernised
to avoid tedium.</p>

<p>It has not come within the scope of the present
work to deal exhaustively with Mary’s correspondence,
and many of her most interesting letters have been
unavoidably omitted, preference being given to those
which relate to the more crucial points in her history.</p>

<p>One word may not be out of place here, as to the
now fully recognised necessity of bringing historical
imagination to bear upon any period under consideration;
for unless we throw ourselves into the spirit, the
views, the interests of that period, we shall utterly fail
to form a correct notion of its merits and its short-comings.
The thoughts and opinions, the virtues and
vices of the sixteenth century are not those of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
own day, and the only way in which we can form a
just estimate of them is by divesting ourselves of every
preconceived notion, and by judging each individual
case according to the standard which then prevailed.
Whether, bearing this necessity in mind, and with the
colours at my disposal, I have succeeded in painting a
picture vivid enough to supersede the old traditional,
but generally spurious, portraits of Queen Mary, I
must leave to the kind judgment of my readers.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">BIRTH AND CHILDHOOD—EARLY MARRIAGE PROJECTS.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">1516-1525.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was characteristic of the times in which the Princess
Mary was born, that she should be ushered into the world
with a pageant. England had but lately been roused from
the lethargy to which the penuriousness of Henry VII. had
condemned it, and good-fellowship, display and revelry were
the order of the day.</p>

<p>Music and masquerades delighted the young King, and
were a fitting background to his florid beauty, brilliant
talents and sanguine temperament. The country, in its
recoil from the asceticism of parsimony, no less than from
the asceticism of mediæval piety, was well content to amuse
itself, and Christmas revels, April jollities and May-day
masques were supplemented by tilting at the ring, feasting
and tournaments, that made the whole year round a “playing
holiday”.</p>

<p>But the desire of the nation was an heir to the greatness,
wealth and glory which the English people rejoiced to see
centred in their eighth Henry. Three times had their
hope been doomed to disappointment, when on the 19th
February<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> 1516, Katharine of Arragon gave birth to a
daughter. The universal satisfaction was scarcely lessened
by the fact that the infant was not the longed-for prince, and
in an ecstasy of joy, the Londoners lighted bonfires, roasted
oxen whole, and caused the wine to flow merrily in the
streets.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<p>Two days later, the Princess, nearly the whole of whose
life was to be so great a contrast to its rosy dawn, was
baptised with much circumstance and pomp at Greenwich.
From the palace gates to the church of the Friars Observants,
the well-gravelled path was strewn with rushes, and hung
with arras. At the great doors of the church a pavilion
covered with tapestry had been erected, and here the
child waited with her sponsors to receive the preliminary
rites before being carried into the sacred building. Then
the procession was formed, and swept through the grand
entrance, only used on the most solemn occasions.</p>

<p>The church was resplendent with cloth of gold, precious
stones, pearl embroideries, and tapestries from the famous
looms of Europe. First walked a goodly array of the
nobility, preceding the silver font, brought the day before
from Canterbury,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and carried by the Earl of Devon, supported
by Lord Herbert of Cherbury. The taper was held
by the Earl of Surrey, the salt by the Marquis, the chrism
by the Marchioness of Dorset. The Lord Chamberlain
followed, with the Lord Steward on his right, and under
a rich canopy, held by four knights, was the royal infant,
in the arms of the Countess of Surrey. On each side of
her walked the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk. The
sponsors at the font were the Cardinal of York (Wolsey),
the Lady Katharine, sister of the Prince of Castile (afterwards
Charles V.) and the Duchess of Norfolk. Immediately
after the baptism followed the bishoping or rite of confirmation,
at which the Countess of Salisbury, the celebrated
Margaret Plantagenet, daughter of the Duke of Clarence,
was sponsor. By her descent from Edward IV. she was
a near kinswoman of Mary’s, and was appointed her
governess or principal guardian, next to the king and
queen.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> was sung by the King’s chaplain, after
which Mary’s style was proclaimed by the heralds:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>“God give good life and long unto the right high,
right noble and right excellent Princess Mary, Princess of
England, and daughter of our sovereign lord the King,” etc.</p>

<p>The Venetian ambassador, Sebastian Giustinian, to whose
letter we owe the account of the royal christening, makes no
mention of the King as having taken part in the procession,
but it is probable that Henry witnessed the ceremony from
the royal closet, which connected the church of the friars
with the palace. The chronicler also omits to say by whom
the sacraments of baptism and confirmation were administered,
a curious oversight, as the Archbishops of Armagh
and Dublin, as well as the Bishops of Durham and Chester,
and the Cardinal-Archbishop of York, were present.
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> When
Giustinian congratulated Henry on the birth of his daughter,
in the name of the Council of Ten, adding, however, that
the Signory would have been better pleased if the child
had been a son, the King replied:—</p>

<p>“We are both young. If it is a daughter this time, by
the grace of God, the sons will follow.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Giustinian’s despatches are pæans in Henry’s honour.
Who so renowned as the King of England! He is not
only “very expert in arms, most excellent in bodily endowments”
of every description, but he is also adorned with
mental accomplishments far beyond the average. And the
admiration of the envoy is not merely general, but detailed.
Sagudino, his secretary, writing from the court at Richmond,
where he spent a week, together with Giustinian, says that
in the evening, they enjoyed hearing the King play and
sing, and seeing him dance, and run at the ring by day,
“in all which exercises he acquitted himself divinely”. He
spoke English, French and Latin, understood Italian, and
played almost every instrument. It was the prettiest thing
in the world to see him play tennis, “his fair skin glowing
through a shirt of the finest texture”. On hearing that
Francis I., his great rival, wore a beard, although it was
not the English fashion, Henry allowed his own to grow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and as it was of a reddish colour, he is described as having
“gotten himself a beard that looks like gold”.<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>“Is the King of France as tall as I am?” he asked of
Pasqualigo, the Venetian envoy to the French Court, who
had special instructions to bring about a friendship between
Henry and Francis, who was the sworn ally of the Republic
of Venice.</p>

<p>Pasqualigo answered diplomatically, that there was little
difference in height between them, although Henry was in
reality much taller than Francis.</p>

<p>“Is he stout?”</p>

<p>The envoy replied that he was not.</p>

<p>“What sort of legs has he?”</p>

<p>“Spare,” answered Pasqualigo guardedly; upon which
Henry opened the front of his doublet, clapped his hand
on his thigh, and exclaimed: “Look here, I have a good
calf to my leg”.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Pasqualigo was to return to France, and before his
departure, Henry took part in a tournament, in which he is
declared to have looked “like St. George on horseback”.
Sagudino adds slyly, “the king exerted himself to the utmost,
that Pasqualigo might make a good report of his prowess to
Francis,” and he “never saw so beautiful a sight”.<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Henry’s love of learning, his knowledge of theology, his
piety, are still more praised. Were it not for the little
saving-clause concerning his jealousy of the King of France,
and one or two youthful indiscretions, one might ask in
vain for a sign of human frailty. He heard three Masses a
day, when he hunted, and on other days, often four or five.
He followed Vespers and Compline every day in the queen’s
closet. Of the regularity with which he despatched business
we have still proofs, in the papers belonging to this period
in the Record Office.</p>

<p>But <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corruptio optimi pessima</i>, and Wolsey is mainly responsible
for his degeneration, by exercising an almost
boundless influence over the King, to flatter his already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
inordinate vanity. The Venetians were meanwhile so much
dazzled by Henry’s brilliant qualities, that they had little
admiration left for the Queen. Sagudino dismisses her with
the disparaging remark, “she is rather ugly than otherwise,”
and the ambassador himself says, “she is not handsome, but
has a very beautiful complexion, is very religious, and as
virtuous as words can express”.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Gerard de Pleine, in a
letter to Margaret of Savoy, describes her as of a lively and
gracious disposition, quite the opposite of her sister, Joan of
Arragon.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Her music and dancing were admired, and it was
said that she read, wrote and composed in English much
better and more correctly than half the ladies of her court.
To this Erasmus adds his testimony and says, “Katharine
is not only a miracle of learning, but is not less pious than
learned”.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> She was a tertiary of St. Francis, and wore a
religious habit under her ordinary dress. Lord Herbert of
Cherbury remarks on her virtue and sweet disposition.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But
to appreciate qualities such as the Queen’s needed more than
the rather superficial discernment of Giustinian and his companions,
who were so much struck with the pomp and glitter
of the English court, that its real worth almost escaped their
notice. Erasmus declared that in its serious aspects, it was
“more like a museum than a court”.</p>

<p>During the first years of their marriage, the King and Queen
had lived together in almost perfect happiness. Katharine
was Henry’s chosen adviser, the confidante of his state secrets,
and the principal negotiatrix between England and Spain.<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
We have Henry’s own words to prove that the union was not
a mere political one. In a letter written in the highest spirits
to Ferdinand of Arragon, the King declared that his love for
his wife was such that, if he were still free, he would choose
her again in preference to all others.<a name="FNanchor_13_13"
id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Of Katharine’s wifely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
devotion to Henry there has never been any doubt. She
adored him, and thought him a paragon of perfection. But
the birth of her daughter threw Katharine henceforth into
the shade, and Wolsey, by his consummate state-craft, rapidly
gained an ascendency over the King.</p>

<p>For years, Mary was the pivot on which the personal advantages
of both King and Chancellor turned, now in one
direction, now in another. Her title of Princess of England
was equivalent to that of heiress apparent, and thus from the
moment of her birth, she became an important piece on the
chess-board of European politics. By effecting a brilliant
matrimonial alliance for her, Wolsey conceived that he
would enhance his master’s prestige among his contemporary
sovereigns, and pave the way for his own aggrandisement,
always the <i>primum mobile</i> of his schemes.</p>

<p>Before she was a year old, Mary was provided with a
household, and Margaret, Lady Bryan,<a name="FNanchor_14_14"
id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> a woman of sound
sense and ability, was appointed “lady maistress” over it.
Her nurse, Katharine Pole, received £26 in March 1517,
being half a year’s salary. Her priest, chaplain or clerk of
the closet, Sir Henry Rowte, had a stipend of sixpence a day.
Alys Baker, a gentlewoman of her household, received £10
a year, and to Avis Wood, her laundress, was paid the sum
of thirty-three shillings and four pence, as wages for six
months.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>While still in her cradle, the Princess figured in a part she
was often called upon to play afterwards. Henry’s sister,
the Queen Dowager of France, being now married to Charles
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, gave birth to a daughter, and
Katharine and Mary were the child’s godmothers. Dignity
followed upon dignity, and before she was two years old
Mary was an important factor in the treaty by which Henry
VIII. ceded Tournay to the French for the sum of 600,000
crowns. The peace between France and England had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
brought about partly through Wolsey’s increasing influence,
partly (the Venetians flattered themselves mainly) through
the tact and diplomacy of Giustinian, sent for that purpose
back to England, and when a Dauphin was expected in 1518,
Wolsey eagerly entered into negotiations with the French
King, for the purpose of contracting a union between Henry’s
only daughter and the hoped-for heir to the throne of France.
Giustinian was, however, not so much in Wolsey’s confidence
in this matter as might have been expected from the nature
of his embassy to England, and some time after the birth of
the Dauphin he wrote: “The French secretary has left, and
is to be replaced by two great personages, to conclude, as it is
said, a marriage between the Princess Mary and the Dauphin.
The Cardinal will not admit this, but I am convinced of the
truth of it.”</p>

<p>The secret soon oozed out, with the result that Mary was
treated with even greater respect and ceremony than before,
being regarded not only as heiress apparent to the throne of
England, but as future Queen of France also. The Venetian
envoys, in reporting to the Doge an interview which they had
had with Henry and Wolsey, on the 28th February 1518,
conclude their account of the audience in these words:—</p>

<p>“After this, the Princess Mary, who is two years old, was
brought in. The Cardinal and Sebastiano kissed her hand
<i>pro more</i>, the greatest marks of honour being paid to her
universally, more than to the queen herself. The moment
she cast her eyes on the Reverend Dionysius Memo, who was
there at a little distance, she began calling out in English:
‘Priest, priest,’ and he was obliged to go and play for her,
after which the King, with the Princess in his arms, came to
me and said: ‘Per Deum iste est honestissimus vir et unus
carissimus; nullus unquam servivit mihi fidelius et melius illo;
scribatis Domino vestro quod habeat ipsum commendatum’.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16"
id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Dionysius Memo was a musician, sent to Henry by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Doge as his chaplain and choir-master. Henry’s love of
music, which Mary inherited, insured him a cordial welcome,
and Memo took an important part at every state function.
On the occasion of a banquet given by the king to the
Austrian ambassador, to celebrate a league sworn between
Henry and his nephew Charles in 1517, there were amusements
of every kind, but especially instrumental music conducted
by Memo, “which lasted for four consecutive hours
to the so great admiration of all the audience, and with
such marks of delight from his Majesty, as to defy exaggeration”.
Five days later, a joust with costly decorations took
place, followed by another banquet, at which no person was
seated under the rank of a marquis. Giustinian is dazzled
with the splendour of the repast, and the profusion of plate,
the sideboard being covered with magnificent vessels, said to
be all of gold. This was one of a series of revels and festivities,
“but the chief dish” is always Memo’s music.<a name="FNanchor_17_17"
id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>On the 3rd October 1518, a general peace was proclaimed
at St. Paul’s. Mass was said by Wolsey with unusual pomp,
and the terms of the treaty between Henry and Francis were
read before the high altar.</p>

<p>The King afterwards dined with the Bishop of London,
going in the afternoon to Durham House in the Strand.
“From thence,” says the Venetian ambassador, “the Cardinal
of York was followed by the entire company to his own
dwelling, where we sat down to a most sumptuous supper,
the like of which, I fancy, was never given, either by Cleopatra
or Caligula, the whole banqueting-hall being so decorated
with huge vases of gold and silver, that I fancied myself in
the tower of Chosroes, where that monarch caused divine
honours to be paid him. After supper, a mummery consisting
of twelve male and female maskers made an appearance, in
the richest and most gorgeous array possible, all being dressed
alike. When they had gone through certain original dances,
they took off their masks. The two leaders of the dance were
the King and the Queen Dowager of France. All the others
were lords and ladies of the court. They seated themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
at separate tables, and were served with countless dishes of
confections and other delicacies. When they had gratified
their palates they regaled their eyes and hands, large bowls
filled with ducats and dice being placed on the table for such
as liked to gamble. Then, the supper tables being removed,
dancing began and lasted till after midnight.”</p>

<p>On the 5th, the Princess Mary was formally betrothed to
the Dauphin, in the Queen’s great chamber at Greenwich.
Henry stood in front of the throne, having the Queen on his
right, the Dowager Queen of France, his sister, on his left
hand. In front of her mother stood the baby Princess, dressed
in cloth of gold, a cap of black velvet covered with precious
stones on her flaxen head. Facing the royal group were the
two legates, Wolsey and Campeggio. Tunstal, Bishop of
London, made an eloquent oration in praise of matrimony,
“which being ended,” says Giustinian, “the most illustrious
Princess was taken in arms, and the magnificos, the French
ambassadors, having asked the consent of the King and Queen,
on behalf of each of the contracting parties, and they having
assented, the right reverend legate, the Cardinal of York,
placed on her finger a small ring, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">juxta digitum puellæ</i>, but
in which a large diamond was set, supposed to be a present
from his right reverend lordship above mentioned; and my
lord admiral passed it over the second joint. The bride
was then blessed by the two right reverend legates, after a
long exordium from the Cardinal of York, every possible
ceremony being observed.” They then went to the royal
chapel within the palace, where the King and Bonivet, the
French ambassador, in the name of Francis I., exchanged
oaths before the high altar, to observe faithfully the articles
of the treaty. The proceedings ended with Mass, Wolsey
being the officiating prelate. “The choir,” wrote the admiring
Venetian, “was decorated with cloth of gold, and all the
court in such rich array, the like of which I never saw, either
here or elsewhere.”</p>

<p>On the 16th, the King at the head of his council promised
publicly to fulfil the marriage contract when the Dauphin
should have attained the age of fourteen, his daughter being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
sixteen years old, and he desired, if he failed in his promises
that the Cardinal would excommunicate him, and pass sentence
of interdict on his kingdom. Mary was to have a dowry of
100,000 marks, and Francis bound himself, under pain of
the censures of the Church, to contribute one as large as
any Queen of France ever had.<a name="FNanchor_18_18"
id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>At the French court, the betrothal was celebrated with
no less elaborate ritual, in which cloth of gold and silver,
jewels, music, flowers, feasting, compliments and promises
played an important part. No one wore any material less
costly than silk. All the English envoys had chains of gold
about their necks, were attired in the most sumptuous fashion,
were praised, banqueted and amused for a whole week, while
the King showered gifts upon them. Never was marriage
contract celebrated with greater solemnity. The expressions
of friendship exchanged by the two Kings were profuse.
Henry sent Francis the most flattering messages; Francis
doffed his cap, and kissed Henry’s letters before opening them.</p>

<p>For a few months Henry seems to have considered himself
bound by this contract, or at least, to have seen no reason
for breaking it. He told Francis that if he should die without
heirs male, he intended to leave the regency of England
to him, as it would belong to the Princess Mary, who was to
marry his son.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>One day, he showed Giustinian with much pride, his young
daughter in her nurse’s arms. The Venetian knelt and kissed
her hand, “for that,” said he, “is alone kissed by any duke or
noble of the land, let his degree be what it may; nor does
any one see her without doffing his bonnet, and making obeisance
to her”. Henry then said: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domine orator, per Deum
immortalem ista puella nunquam plorat,</span>” upon which Giustinian,
with ready diplomacy, replied: “Sacred Majesty, the
reason is that her destiny does not move her to tears; she
will one day be Queen of France,” words which, he declared,
“pleased the king vastly”.<a name="FNanchor_20_20"
id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, as early as September 1519, steps were
taken for adopting another line of policy altogether, and for
transferring Mary’s hand to the Emperor, Charles V.</p>

<p>The news of the French alliance had greatly disturbed the
Spanish Ministry, for the Emperor’s political complications
were many. The King of France had become, through
Charles’s successful candidature for the empire, his implacable
enemy. War was unavoidable, for it behoved the emperor
to secure his overgrown possessions, by every means in his
power.</p>

<p>Even alone, Francis constituted a formidable danger, on
account of his pretensions in Italy, but when allied to England,
which, thanks to Wolsey’s foreign policy, was fast
emerging from the condition of a third-rate power, he might
threaten the dismemberment of the empire. Moreover, money
would be urgently needed to carry on the war, when Francis
should begin hostilities, and although Charles was already
pledged to marry the Princess Charlotte of France, he was
also negotiating a union with the daughter of the King of
Portugal, by which he would receive 80,000 crowns as her
dowry. For the sake of his empty coffers, he was prepared
to sell himself to the highest bidder. He demanded a million
ducats with the Princess Mary. Wolsey offered 80,000, with
the understanding that the sums already advanced by Henry
should be deducted therefrom, thus reducing the dowry to
50,000. Charles was careful not to commit himself. In a
pecuniary sense, the Portuguese Princess was clearly the more
desirable, but there remained the necessity of breaking the
Anglo-French alliance. A see-saw policy was, therefore, his
only alternative.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mary’s betrothal to the Dauphin was supposed
to stand good, and Charles continued his negotiation with
Portugal. Francis was well-informed by spies of all that
went on, and Henry knew that he knew, but all parties
thought well to dissemble. When rumour became too loud
to be disregarded, and the fact of the correspondence between
Henry and Charles leaked out, Henry affected indignation, and
warmly protested his loyalty to the French treaty. Francis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
replied, with more politeness than truth, that the King of
England need not have troubled himself to disprove the
calumny, for he himself gave it no credence.<a name="FNanchor_21_21"
id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In England, public opinion was in favour of the more
brilliant marriage. The nation had never looked with cordiality
on the prospect of a French union. Mary was the
future sovereign of England; if she married the Dauphin, a
French monarch would one day be seated on the English
throne, an unpleasant humiliation for those who considered
France the rightful appanage of English kings.</p>

<p>Katharine also naturally inclined to the Spanish match.
Although she had thrown herself heart and soul into the
habits, tastes and interests of her adopted country, she retained
a deep love for all that was Spanish. She never
forgot that she was the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella,
and foreign ambassadors wishing to gain her favour would
address her in the Spanish tongue. Nothing was nearer
her heart than a marriage between her daughter and her
nephew. In England, all were eager for the union, but
Charles held back, delaying his promised visit to his relatives
almost beyond the limits of courtesy. Henry was not a little
embarrassed, for while the imperial machinery was being
slowly put into motion, Francis, anxious to outwit his rival,
had himself proposed a meeting for the ratification of the
marriage treaty. Henry and Wolsey, on the horns of a
dilemma, sought in vain to postpone the interview indefinitely.
Francis was bent on it, and various dates having
been objected to, in the hope that the project would be abandoned,
the 31st of May was at last fixed for their meeting.
Whether or no this action on the part of the French King had
any effect on the Emperor’s policy, Charles at once made up
his mind, and landed at Dover on the 26th. He was received
by the Cardinal of York, and Henry, who had awaited his
arrival at Canterbury, rode over to meet him. The next day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
being Whitsunday, he escorted him to the city of St. Thomas,
“the more to solempne the Feast of Pentecost; but specially
to see the Queen of England, his aunt, was the intent of the
emperor”.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>What passed between these three royal personages and
Wolsey did not transpire. A further loan may have been
effected, but the public records are silent on the real object
of the visit, and do not even state, whether the bridegroom
<i>in posse</i> saw his proposed bride. On the 31st, he
re-embarked at Sandwich, and the King and Queen, with
Wolsey and a brilliant suite, crossed over to Calais. On
landing, they immediately proceeded to Guisnes, and the
same day, Francis arrived at Ardres, about six miles distant.<a name="FNanchor_23_23"
id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Descriptions are not wanting of the empty splendours of
Field of the Cloth of Gold. The world had never before
witnessed such a scene, such fantastic devices, such jewels,
such cordiality, such fraternal affection between two Kings.
Had Henry and Francis been brothers, meeting after a long
and painful separation, their joy at being reunited could not
have been more expansive. They met in a summer palace
of glass, hastily prepared for the occasion, but covered from
roof to floor with white fluted satin, and relieved by rich
hangings of cloth of gold, while pearls and precious stones of
immense value were strewn with oriental prodigality in every
direction. Exquisitely designed fountains ran wine all day,
and feats of arms were followed by costly banquets, at which
all the grace and beauty of the two courts were represented.</p>

<p>Religion and chivalry were still supposed to go hand in
hand, and the magnificence of the King’s temporary palace
was only equalled by the magnificence of his temporary
chapel, where gorgeous functions took place, and sermons
were preached, in pompous language, on the blessings of
peace and amity between princes. The whole scene was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
dazzling epitome of the Renaissance. The two Kings parted
seemingly on the best of terms; Henry and Wolsey proceeded
to Gravelines to meet the Emperor, and the three
went together to Calais, to plot against the host, at whose
hands Henry had just received such lavish hospitality.</p>

<p>Keen as was Francis’s eye to penetrate diplomatic
mysteries, he does not seem on this occasion to have
fathomed the depths of Henry’s capacity for intrigue, for
he hovered about the frontier, vainly hoping to be invited to
join the conference at Calais. Henry had solemnly declared
to him that he entertained no purpose of espousing Mary
to the Emperor, and had sworn eternal friendship with him
as his ally and future son-in-law,<a name="FNanchor_24_24"
id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> although the principal
object of his pending conference with Charles, was to
discuss the means of transferring his daughter’s hand from
the Dauphin to the greatest enemy of France.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Princess Mary, the innocent object of these
plots, was still happily unconscious of her value in the eyes of
politicians. She remained at Richmond Palace during the
absence of the court, and Henry was kept well informed of
her health and occupations. The Duke of Norfolk wrote to
him on the 13th June, that he and the other members of the
Council were, “on Saturday last,” with the Princess, “who,
lauded be Almighty God, is right merry, and in prosperous
health and state, daily exercising herself in virtuous pastimes”.<a name="FNanchor_25_25"
id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
“On St. Peter’s Even,” as the lords of the Council informed
him, “came the three gentlemen of France, of whose arrival
they had notice from the Cardinal, and on Saturday, after
dinner, as the tide was commodious, they being well accompanied
by the lord Barnes, lord Darcy, and another, visited
the Princess, at Richmond. There were with her,” they
continue, “divers lords spiritual and temporal, and in the Presence
Chamber, besides the lady governess and her other
gentlewomen, the Duchess of Norfolk,” etc. They go on to
say that she “welcomed the French gentlemen with most
goodly countenance, proper communication, and pleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
pastime in playing on the virginals; and they greatly marvelled
and rejoiced at the same, her young and tender age
considered”.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>When we consider that this “<i>young and tender age</i>” represented
but four short years, we cannot but feel sorry for the
small lady, obliged to entertain visitors with “proper communication,”
instead of amusing herself with her “rosemary
bushes with gold spangles,” her “gold pomanders,” and other
sixteenth century toys, which were continually being brought
to her as presents. The Princess’s <i>Household Book</i> for 1520
informs us that she regaled those “gentlemen from France”
with “four gallons of Ypocras, with cherries, old apples, wafers,
and strawberries, the cost of which amounted to thirty-five
shillings and threepence”.</p>

<p>Tokens were constantly exchanged between the Dauphin
and his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</span></i>. In January 1521,
Sir Peter Carew was sent
over to Paris, to condole with Francis I. on an accident he
had met with, and to inquire after his health. He took with
him some rubies as presents, and the French defrayed his
expenses, and prepared “some scents and smocks” for him
to take back with him, as presents to the Princess.<a name="FNanchor_27_27"
id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> According
to the existing arrangements, the Dauphin was to
be sent over to England to be brought up in this country
when he was a few years old; but long before the time
specified, Mary had been solemnly affianced to the Emperor,
although her marriage-contract with the Dauphin was never
annulled.</p>

<p>Until Mary was twelve years old, her health and education
were the subjects of Henry’s constant solicitude, and
apart from the value he set upon her as an important item
in his political schemes, he appears to have regarded her
with affection, as long as there was room in his character
for natural feeling, or any sentiment unconnected with his
dominant passions. The care of her health necessitated her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
frequent removal from one royal residence to another, as
a precaution against infectious disease, rendered necessary
by the conditions of life in England during the first half of
the sixteenth century. The well-known letter written by
Erasmus to Wolsey’s physician, testifies to the perpetual
recurrence of the plague in this country, which was to be
attributed, the writer considered, mainly to the construction
of the houses, full indeed of windows, but as these were
not made to open, light was admitted into the dwellings,
but no air. He complains of the chalk floors and of the
rushes laid thereon, but so carelessly renewed, that the
bottom layer often remained for twenty years, harbouring
all sorts of offal.</p>

<p>Writing in 1527, Erasmus says that thirty years before,
if he entered a room uninhabited for some months previously,
he caught a fever. It would have been well if some of
the money lavished on the adornment of the walls had
been expended on the floors, especially as the habits of the
sixteenth century left much to be desired in point of cleanliness.
Some attention was, however, given to this matter
in the royal palaces, but it was of a kind that involved
the removal of the court, whenever a room was to be
thoroughly overhauled; the result of disturbing rushes upon
which dogs had been fed and kennelled for months, and
every kind of refuse allowed to rot, may be better imagined
than described. There is little cause for surprise, therefore,
if we hear constantly of fevers, agues and of the sweating
sickness, more deadly than the plague.</p>

<p>On one occasion, news was brought to the court that
“one of my lady princess’s servants was sick of a hot ague”
at Enfield, whereupon Henry ordered that Mary should be
taken at once to Byssham Abbey, remain there one day,
and arrive at the More the day following. Even when
the servant recovered, Mary was not allowed to return to
Enfield. In August 1520, we find that “my lady princess
will be sent to Richmond again, on account of the reports
of the sickness at Woodstock”.</p>

<p>The excellent Lady Bryan having ceased in 1521, to occupy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the position of governess of Mary’s household, Secretary
Pace wrote to Wolsey that as the King intended leaving
Windsor shortly, and as he would have no convenient lodging
for the Princess, he desired Wolsey to think of some lady
fit to give attendance on her. The King thought that the
old Lady Oxford would be suitable, if she could be persuaded,
if not, Lady Calthorpe, and her husband to be
chamberlain to the Princess. Accordingly, Lady Oxford
was invited to occupy the vacant post.</p>

<p>Wolsey describes her as “right discreet, and of a good
age, and near at hand,” and she could at least “be tried
for a season, if she did not decline on the score of health”.
Apparently she did decline, for instead of Lady Oxford,
we find Sir Philip Calthorpe and his wife appointed to
attend on the Princess, and govern her house, with a salary
of £40 a year.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"
class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>On the 29th July 1521, a commission was appointed
to conclude a treaty for Mary’s marriage with the Emperor
for which a dispensation was to be obtained from the Pope
on account of their near relationship. This treaty was concluded,
signed and sealed on the 24th November of the
same year, on which day also, Francis I., writing to his
ambassador in London, remarks that the contract between
the Princess of England and the Dauphin is to remain in
its entirety,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a> a curious satire on the good faith of princes.
Moreover, while Francis thus proclaimed the peace and
amity supposed to exist between himself and Henry, Charles
was stipulating with Henry for a descent to be made by
the English on the shores of France, not later than March,
1522. A fleet was to be provided by both parties, each
contributing 3,000 men. It would be possible to regard
Francis with some pity, as a miserable dupe, were it not
for his own propensity for the same amount of false
swearing. By February, he was in possession of the facts,
but for some reason or other, war was not declared till June.
On the 6th May, Contarini, the Venetian envoy, was able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
to inform the Signory of Mary’s approaching betrothal to
the Emperor, adding that Henry was about to send a
gentleman to France, to repudiate the French treaty.</p>

<p>On the 27th, Charles landed at Dover, and was received
on the sands by Wolsey, attended by 300 nobles, knights
and gentlemen. Leaning on the Cardinal’s arm, the Emperor
proceeded to Dover Castle, where he remained for two days,
being joined by Henry. On the road to Canterbury, and
thence to Greenwich, they were greeted by the people with
every demonstration of joy, the English looking upon Charles
as the monarch of the world, and feeling flattered by his
condescension in wedding a daughter of England.<a name="FNanchor_30_30"
id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> At the
great gates of Greenwich Palace stood the Queen and her
daughter Mary, now six years old, to welcome him. The
Emperor dropped on one knee, and asked Katharine’s blessing,
“having,” says the chronicler Hall, “great joy to see the
queen, his aunt, and in especiall his young cousin germain,
the lady Mary”.</p>

<p>All who saw Mary at this time spoke favourably of her
appearance. “She promises,” said Martin de Salinas, “to
become a handsome lady, although it is difficult to form
an idea of her beauty, as she is still so small.” Others
describe her as a fair child, with a profusion of flaxen
ringlets, and the admiration of all.</p>

<p>The usual revels were held in honour of the Emperor’s
visit. The court removed to London, and Charles was
magnificently lodged at Blackfriars. But he seems to have
regarded the prodigality displayed with Hapsburg seriousness,
if not with absolute disapproval. He was urgently
in need of money, and would doubtless have been better
pleased with a fresh loan, than with all that was done in his
honour. At all events, the sombre stateliness of Windsor
was more in accordance with his taste and humour, and he
was altogether in his native element when the terms of the
treaty were at last discussed. These included: (1) a settlement
of the differences between the Emperor and Francis;
(2) a marriage contract between the Emperor and the Princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Mary; (3) a league between the Emperor and Henry for
making war upon France, and for recovering the territory
which the English had lost in that country. A clause was
inserted, to the effect that Mary should be sent to Spain to
finish her education, when she was twelve years old.<a name="FNanchor_31_31"
id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
treaty of Windsor was signed on the 19th June, but was not
then published, and “peace with France was dissembled”.
Other things were dissembled also; and, although Mary was
brought to Windsor, to take leave of her imperial cousin as
his future bride, Wolsey soon discovered that no reliance
could be placed on the Emperor’s words or promises, and
that, as far as Charles was concerned, the whole negotiation
and the treaty of Windsor itself were nothing but a political
fiction, in order to alarm Francis. But indeed, in a competition
of duplicity between Charles, Henry, Francis and Wolsey, it
would be rash to speculate as to which of them would have
borne the palm. Wolsey played a particularly odious part,
inasmuch as he not only convinced Francis that he was anxious
for the French alliance, but he was moreover in receipt of a
yearly pension from him. Meanwhile, the determination of
the Princess Isabella of Portugal to marry Charles served to
further complicate matters. She took for her motto the
trenchant device, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aut Cæsar aut
nihil</span></i>,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and the grandees of
Spain threw their weight into the scale with her, urging the
Emperor to marry her, with whom he would receive a million
of gold, and not the English Princess, “about whom he thought
less than of the first named”.<a name="FNanchor_33_33"
id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Still Charles hesitated, or
affected to hesitate, and writing to Wolsey from Valladolid,
the 10th February 1523, he begs to have news of the King:
“et de ma mieulx aimee fiancee la Princesse, future Imperatrix”.<a name="FNanchor_34_34"
id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
But much as Henry held to the fulfilment of
the contract, he had no longer any real hope of it, and began
to look for other possible alliances. It was thought in France
that the Dauphin would soon be crowned, and that then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
would marry the English princess,<a name="FNanchor_35_35"
id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> but Gonzolles,
the French ambassador in Scotland, wrote to the Duke of Albany: “The
King of England has promised to give his daughter in marriage
to the King of Scots, with a large pension, and proclaim him
prince of his kingdom if they can agree”.</p>

<p>Henry would nevertheless have much preferred giving her
to the Emperor, if by any means Charles could be persuaded
to keep to his engagements, and he sent Tunstal, Bishop
of London, and Sir Richard Wingfield, as extraordinary
ambassadors to Spain, with orders to promote the marriage
in every possible way.</p>

<p>In April 1525, Mary sent Charles an emerald with a
curious message, showing that she was still taught to consider
herself his promised bride. “Her Grace,” so ran the letter
which accompanied the gift, “hath devised this token, for
a better knowledge to be had, when God shall send them
grace to be together, whether his Majesty do keep himself as
continent and chaste as with God’s grace she woll, whereby
ye may say, his Majesty may see that her assured love towards
the same hath already such operation in her, that it is also
confirmed by jealousy, being one of the greatest signs and
tokens of hearty love and cordial affection.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36"
id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>After the victory of Pavia, Charles, no longer in fear of
Francis, declared openly that he owed nothing to the help
of his allies, and released himself from his pledges to Henry
by the very extravagance of his demands. He sent a commission
to Wolsey requiring that Mary should be sent to
Spain at once, with a dowry of 400,000 ducats, and 200,000
crowns besides, to defray the expenses of the war with France.
Nothing was said about the sums he had borrowed from Henry,
while the whole transaction was in direct violation of the
terms of the treaty of Windsor. The Cardinal replied that
the Princess was still too young to be given up, and that the
Spaniards had no hostages to offer that could be sufficient
security for her, whom the English people looked upon as
the treasure of the kingdom. The envoys whom the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
sent in return, in paying their respects to the King and Queen,
were permitted to address “a short peroration in Latin to the
Princess, to which she replied in the same tongue, with as
much assurance and facility as if she were twelve years old,”
and she did and said, they added, “many other gracious
things on the occasion, of which they purpose giving an
account at a future time”.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But the moment for fair speeches
and compliments had gone by. Charles demanded that
Henry should either agree to his conditions, or release him
from his oath, “for all Spain” compelled him “to contract a
marriage with Portugal”. Henry told him roundly that he
would give him his daughter when she was of proper age, but
no increase of dowry.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"
class="fnanchor">[38]</a> “If,” continued the King of England,
“he should seek a maistress for hyr, to frame hyr after the
manner of Spayne, and of whom she might take example of
virtue, he shulde not find in all Christendome a more mete than
she now hath, that is the Quene’s grace, her mother, who is

<p>At the same time Tunstal and Wingfield represented that,
as the Princess was not much more than nine years old, it might
greatly endanger her health to be transported into an air so
different from that of England. In replying more particularly
to the Emperor’s statement, that his subjects wished him to
marry the Portuguese Princess, Mary being still of tender
age, Henry, seeing that nothing was to be gained by a breach
with his nephew-in-law, told him that the Princess his daughter
was still young; she was his own treasure and that of his
kingdom; she was not of age to be married;<a name="FNanchor_40_40"
id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> that the demands
of the Spanish people seemed reasonable, and that desiring
always to preserve the Emperor’s friendship, he consented to
the Portuguese alliance under three conditions. These were:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
(1) that peace should be made with France; (2) that the
Emperor should pay his debts to Henry; (3) that the treaties
of Windsor and London should be annulled.<a name="FNanchor_41_41"
id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>The treaty of Windsor was rescinded on the 6th July
1525, and on the 22nd was signed the marriage contract
between Charles V. and Isabella of Portugal. But the Emperor
did not pay his debts, and henceforth no Spaniard
coveted the post of ambassador to the English Court. To
console Henry for the failure of his schemes, Tunstal assured
him that Mary was “a pearl well worth the keeping”.<a name="FNanchor_42_42"

<p class="ac noindent">PRINCESS OF WALES.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">1525-1527.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mary was about ten years old, her father, mindful
it was said of his Welsh origin, turned his attention towards
that principality, thinking wisely by redressing some of its
grievances to reduce it to a more strict obedience. It
was, therefore, determined by the King in Council, to send
“our dearest, best beloved, and only daughter, the Princess,
accompanied with an honourable, sad, discreet and expert
counsayle, to reside and remain in the Marches of Wales
and the parties thereabouts, furnished with sufficient power
and authority to hold courts of <i>oyer</i> and <i>determiner</i>, for the
better administration of justice”.<a name="FNanchor_43_43"
id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Disappointed in his hope of further issue, Henry had,
in a more special manner than at her christening, declared
his daughter heiress to the Crown, and Princess of
Wales, consoling himself with the conviction, that her
extreme popularity would be a sufficient counterpoise to
the somewhat hazardous novelty of a queen regnant. The
news of her departure for the west was communicated
to the Venetian Government by Lorenzo Orio in August,
1525:—</p>

<p>“On Saturday, the Princess went to her principality of
Wales, with a suitable and honourable escort, and she will
reside there until the time of her marriage. She is a rare
person, and singularly accomplished, most particularly in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
music, playing on every instrument, especially on the lute
and harpsichord.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44"
id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The term borders or marches of Wales was somewhat
loosely applied, and “the parties thereabouts” seem to have
included the whole of the south-western, and some of the
midland counties, for we find Mary during this time not only
at Chester and Shrewsbury, but also at Tewkesbury and
Gloucester. A great deal of power was put into the hands
of her council, with the means of enforcing their decrees, but
the details of her short sojourn in the west are very meagre,
and we are entirely dependent on a few sidelights, to show
the kind of authority that was centred in her person, and the
amount of state that was kept. This last was indeed considerable.
A communication from her council to Sir Andrew
Windsor, Sir John Dauncy and Sir William Skeffington,
refers them to the King’s pleasure, “touching such ordnance
and artillery as should be delivered for the Princess into the
marches of Wales, and for despatching the payments for
carriage by land or water. They desire that the two gunners,
John Rauffe and Laurence Clayton, and the armourer,
William Carter, now being the Princess’s servants, may have
livery coats of the Princess’s colours.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45"
id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> What those colours
were may be learned from a letter of Wolsey’s to Sir Andrew
Windsor, authorising him to deliver to Dr. Buttes, “appointed
physician to my lady Princess, a livery of blue and green in
damask, for himself, and in blue and green cloth for his two
servants; also a cloth livery for the apothecary”. On the
margin of a document, in which are inscribed the names of
all the ladies and gentlemen who accompanied the Princess,
is a memorandum, signed by Wolsey, relating to the quantity
of black velvet to be allowed and delivered to each. Those
of inferior rank were to have black damask.</p>

<p>Mary’s head-quarters were at Ludlow, but she travelled
constantly from place to place, visiting all the more accessible
parts of the principality, and the surrounding country. On
the 3rd September 1526, she was at Langley, as we learn from
a letter addressed to Wolsey from that place:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>“My lady Princess came on Saturday. Surely, Sir, of her
age, as goodly a child as ever I have seen, and of as good
gesture and countenance. Her Grace was well accompanied
with a goodly number of persons of gravity.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46"
id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>These “persons of gravity” included, besides councillors,
chamberlains, clerks, surveyors, etc., the Countess of Salisbury,
the Countess of Devon, Lady Katharine Grey, Dr.
Wootton, Dean of the Chapel; Mr. John Featherstone, schoolmaster,
and many others, amounting in all to 304 persons, of
the most honourable sort.</p>

<p>Mary had authority to kill or give deer at her pleasure, in
any forest or park within the territory appointed to her, and
her warrants were served under pain of the King’s indignation.<a name="FNanchor_47_47"
id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Careful directions had been given by the King in Council,
concerning her own training, health, clothing, food and recreation,
for all of which the Countess of Salisbury was
primarily responsible. She was “to take open air in gardens,
sweet and wholesome places, and walks,” and everything
about her was to be “pure, sweet, clean and wholesome,”
while “all things noisome and displeasant” were to be
“forborne and excluded”. Great attention was to be paid
to her food, and to the manner in which it was served,
with cheerful society, “comfortable, joyous and merry communication,
in all honourable and virtuous maner”. Her
council was to meet once a month, at least, and to consult on
her health, virtuous education, etc., “taking into communication
my lady Governess, and the Princess if expedient”.<a name="FNanchor_48_48"
id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Mr. Featherstone was to instruct her in Latin, in the place of
the Queen, who had hitherto undertaken this branch of her
studies. Shortly before going to Wales, Mary had received a
letter from her mother, in which, after expressing her trouble
at the long absence of the King, and of her daughter, and
assuring her that her health is “meetly good” and that she
rejoices to hear that Mary’s own health is mended, Katharine
goes on to say:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>“As for your writing in Latin, I am glad that ye shall
change from me to master Federston, for that shall do you
much good to learn by him to write aright. But yet sometimes
I would be glad when ye do write to master Federston
of your own inditing, when he hath read it, that I may see it,
for it shall be a great comfort to me to see you keep your
Latin and fair writing and all, and so I pray you to recommend
me to my lady of Salisbury.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49"
id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>Katharine had spared no pains in the education of her
daughter, basing it upon a solid foundation of piety, and imparting
a taste for learning, which helped to support Mary in
the dark days to come. The celebrated Ludovicus Vives had
already contributed to her instruction before her departure into
Wales, and on her return continued to direct one branch of
her studies. In 1524 he had dedicated to the Princess 213
symbols or mottoes, with paraphrases upon each. The first
one was called <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scopus Vitæ Christus</span></i>,
and the last <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mente Deo
defixus</span></i>, “and these,” says a contemporary writer, “the
Princess seemed to have in perpetual memory, by the practice
of her whole life, for she made Christ the beginning and end
of all her actions, from whose goodness all things do proceed,
and to whom all things do tend, having a most lively example
in her virtuous mother”.<a name="FNanchor_50_50"
id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The list of Latin works proposed by Vives, and in which
Mary soon began to delight, is startling from the profound
character of the subjects chosen. Among these works were
the <i>Epistles of St. Jerome</i>, the <i>Dialogues of Plato</i>, “particularly,”
observes Sir Frederick Madden, “those of a political
turn”;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"
class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the works of Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, St. Ambrose,
St. Augustine, St. Thomas, and other equally serious books.</p>

<p>That her mind responded to this severely classical and
religious training, is evident from the remarks scattered
about the correspondence of the more or less distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
personages who at different times came in contact with her.
Her own countrymen were not a little proud of her talents.
Lord Morley, in the preface to his book, <i>A New-Year’s
Angelical Salutation by Tho. Aquine</i>, which he presented to
Mary as a New-Year’s gift, mentions the translation of a
prayer by St. Thomas which she had made. “I do remember,”
he says, “that skante ye were come to xij. yeres of age, but
that ye were so rype in the Laten tongue that rathe doth
happen to the women sex, that your grace not only could perfectly
rede, wright and construe Laten, but furthermore translate
eny harde thing of the Laten in to our Inglysshe tongue,
and among all other your most vertuous occupacions, I have
seen one prayer translated of your doing of Sayncte Thomas
Alquyne, that I do ensuer your grace is so well done, so near
to the Laten, that when I loke upon it, as I have one of the
exemplars of yt, I have not only mervell at the doinge of it,
but further for the well doing, have set yt as well in my boke
or bokes, as also in my pore wyfe’s, your humble beadeswoman,
and my chyldern, to gyve them occasion to remember to praye
for your grace.“<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The Princess of Wales had not long to maintain the vice-regal
dignity in the west. Fresh schemes were on foot for
disposing of her in marriage, and her presence was required
at court.</p>

<p>After his disastrous defeat at Pavia, the news of which
he communicated to his mother in the famous words, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout
est perdu fors l’honneur</span></i>,” Francis I. had been taken captive
to Madrid, from whence he only escaped by submitting to
the most suicidal conditions, leaving his two eldest sons as
hostages in the hands of the Emperor. But having signed
the treaty of Madrid as a prisoner, and being therefore no free
agent, he was scarcely likely to consider its terms binding.
One of its stipulations was that he should marry the Emperor’s
sister, Eleanor, Dowager Duchess of Austria, but this he had
no intention of doing, provided he could regain possession of
his children by any other means.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>In the perpetual game of see-saw played by the three
principal monarchs of Christendom, with a constant change of
partners, it is not surprising to find Francis now looking
towards England for a way out of his difficulties. He had
contrived to form a league against Charles, consisting of the
Pope, the Swiss, the Venetians, and the Florentines; and if
England could be persuaded to join it, this league would be
strong enough to defy the Emperor, and France might not only
regain her lost possessions, but dictate the terms of peace.</p>

<p>But Henry and Wolsey had no particular interest in making
things pleasant for Francis, whose overtures met with no
eager response. It was not clear to the King or his Chancellor
what advantage would be derived by them from an alliance
with Francis.</p>

<p>“This king will not spend money to make an enemy of
his friend, and gain nothing,” replied the astute Wolsey to
the Venetian, Gasparo Spinelli, and he assured him that
England would not join the league, unless his most Christian
Majesty first undertook to restore Boulogne, and to marry the
Princess Mary.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53"
class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>But France had suffered too many humiliating losses
willingly to give up so important a place, and later, when
Henry sent a special envoy to negotiate a marriage between
Mary and Francis, all mention of Boulogne was dropped.</p>

<p>It would seem incredible, but for authentic evidence, that
Henry should have seriously entertained the notion of bestowing
on a middle-aged profligate such as the King of France,
whose actual life would not bear investigation, the young
daughter whom he professed to love and cherish, as “the
pearl of the world”. Nevertheless, for a time at least, his
mind was fixed on this purpose, and Wolsey was never more
keenly alive to his own interests than in the fabrication of
this delicate piece of diplomacy. Francis was equally in
earnest, on account of his impatience to take reprisals on the
Emperor, and the Queen mother, Louise of Savoy, told the
English ambassadors that her son had long been anxious to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
marry their Princess, “both for her manifold virtues and
other gay qualities, which they assured them were not here
unknown”.</p>

<p>The next step was to send ambassadors to England to
treat of the marriage. These were the Bishop of Tarbes,
afterwards Cardinal Grammont, first president of the Parliament
of Toulouse, the Vicomte de Turenne, and La Viste,
president of the Parliament of Paris. They were instructed
by Francis to go straight to the Princess Mary, visit and salute
her in his name, and to express his “sore longing to have her
portraiture”. Hereupon, Henry sent Francis his own and
Mary’s picture,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"
class="fnanchor">[54]</a> assuring him that he was much obliged to
him for condescending to take his little daughter, who did
not deserve such honour.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55"
class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The Venetians looked upon the marriage as certain, and
thought that war would be waged in consequence, in every
direction;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"
class="fnanchor">[56]</a> but the more general opinion in Europe was that
Henry would not succeed in a matrimonial alliance with any
foreign potentate, but that the English would insist on having
a king of their own, and would not suffer a foreigner to sit
upon the throne.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>“In time of war,” said the Archbishop of Capua to
Charles V., “the English made use of their Princess as they
did of an owl, as a decoy for alluring the smaller birds.”
The Emperor, not understanding the allusion, asked the Archbishop
what he meant by “owl,” and when it was explained
to him laughed heartily.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the French envoys saw the Princess, on St.
George’s Day (1527). She spoke to them in French and
Latin, and was made to display her achievements in writing
and on the harpsichord. Spinelli wrote that a solemn betrothal
had taken place at Greenwich, when the Bishop of
Tarbes had delivered an oration, after which he and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Vicomte de Turenne had dined with the King, the others
dining apart. At the end of dinner they went to the Queen’s
apartments, where the Princess danced with de Turenne, who
considered her very handsome, and admirable by reason of
her great and uncommon mental endowments, but so thin,
spare and small, as to render it impossible for her to be
married for the next three years.<a name="FNanchor_58_58"
id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> A succession of jousts
and masks of the most dazzling description followed. Spinelli,
in relating the brilliant course of entertainments, says of one
in particular:—</p>

<p>“Thereupon there fell to the ground at the extremity of
the hall, a painted canvas from an aperture, in which was
seen a most verdant cave approached by four steps, each
side being guarded by four of the chief gentlemen of the
Court, clad in tissue doublets and tall plumes, each of whom
carried a torch. Well grouped, within the cave, were eight
damsels of such rare beauty, as to be supposed goddesses
rather than human beings. They were arrayed in cloth
of gold, their hair gathered into a net, with a very richly
jewelled garland surmounted by a velvet cap, the hanging
sleeves of their surcoats being so long, that they well-nigh
touched the ground, and so well and richly wrought as
to be no slight ornament to their beauty. They descended
gracefully from their seats to the sound of trumpets, the
first of them being the Princess, with the Marchioness of
Exeter. Her beauty in this array produced such effect
on everybody, that all the other marvellous sights previously
witnessed were forgotten, and they gave themselves up solely
to contemplation of so fair an angel. On her person were
so many precious stones, that their splendour and radiance
dazzled the sight, in such wise as to make one believe that
she was decked with all the gems of the eighth sphere.
Dancing thus, they presented themselves to the King, their
dance being very delightful by reason of its variety, as they
formed certain groups and figures most pleasing to the
sight. Their dance being finished, they ranged themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
on one side, and in like order, the eight youths, leaving
their torches, came down from the cave, and after performing
their dances, each of them took by the hand one of those
beautiful nymphs, and having led a courant together, for
a while returned to their places. Six masks then entered.
To detail their costume would be but to repeat the words
‘cloth of gold,’ ‘cloth of silver,’ etc. They chose such
ladies as they pleased for their partners, and commenced
various dances, which being ended, the King appeared. The
French ambassador, the Marquis of Turrenne (<i>sic</i>), was at
his side, and behind him four couples of noblemen all masked,
and all wearing black velvet slippers on their feet, this being
done lest the King should be distinguished from the others,
as from the hurt which he received lately when playing at
tennis, he wears a black velvet slipper. They were all clad
in tissue doublets, over which was a very long and ample
gown of black satin, with hoods of the same material; and
on their heads caps of tawney velvet. They then took by
the hand an equal number of ladies, dancing with great
glee, and at the end of the dance unmasked, whereupon,
the Princess with her companions again descended, and came
to the King, who in the presence of the French ambassadors,
took off her cap, and the net being displaced, a profusion
of silver tresses, as beautiful as ever seen on human head,
fell over her shoulders, forming a most agreeable sight. The
aforesaid ambassadors then took leave of her, and all departing
from that beautiful place, returned to the supper hall,
where the tables were spread with every kind of confection
and choice wines, for all who chose to cheer themselves with
them. The sun I believe greatly hastened his course, having
perhaps had a hint from Mercury of so rare a sight; so
showing himself already on the horizon, warning being thus
given of his presence, everybody thought it time to quit the
royal chambers, returning to their own with such sleepy eyes,
that the daylight could not keep them open.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59"
id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Little progress was, however, made with the negotiations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Compliments flowed freely on both sides, but did not advance
matters, and Wolsey determined to seek an interview with
Francis, bring the affair to a crisis, and settle certain other
matters which had lately supervened, to complicate immeasurably
the tangled politics of Europe. One of these was
the sack of Rome by the imperial army, and the consequent
imprisonment of the Pope and the whole College of
Cardinals, in the Castle of St. Angelo. Another, which
more immediately concerned England, was known as yet
but to a chosen few as “the king’s secret matter,” but which
was ultimately to inflame the whole of Christendom.</p>

<p>Wolsey was flattered, courted and feared by all the
powers. He was at once the most brilliant, the most daring
and the least scrupulous diplomat in Europe. His boundless
ambition was easily entertained by the notion that the Papal
authority might be delegated to himself, during the Pope’s
captivity, and that thus by one swing of the pendulum, he
might be raised to the highest dignity on earth. This one
swing of the pendulum was to be effected by a promise, that
if Henry secured his election, he would, as Pope, pass a
decree in favour of “the king’s secret matter”.<a name="FNanchor_60_60"
id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>But before this dream could be realised, Francis must
be won over to the scheme of his candidature, and the votes
of the French cardinals secured. Francis, bent only on
checkmating the Emperor, was fascinated with the idea of
marrying the English princess, and of drawing England
into the league against Charles; and Wolsey, ever tactful,
kept his own plans in the background, until the royal
suitor should be satisfied.</p>

<p>The Cardinal of York and the French King were to meet
at Amiens, and the moment that Wolsey set foot in France
he received from the King a commission, authorising him to
pardon and liberate under his own letters patent, such prisoners
as he chose, in the towns through which he passed, except
those committed for treason, murder, and similar crimes.
After their first interview, the Cardinal wrote an account to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Henry of all that had passed between them. Francis had
spoken of Mary as “the cornerstone of the new covenant,”
“and I,” added Wolsey, “being her godfather, loving her entirely,
next unto your Highness, and above all other creatures,
assured him that I was desirous she should be bestowed upon
his person, as in the best and most worthy place in Christendom”.</p>

<p>Francis coveted the honour of possessing the Garter, and
his hint to that effect was ingenious, if somewhat broad.
Taking hold of the image of St. Michael, which he wore on
his neck, he said to Wolsey:—</p>

<p>“Now the King, my brother, and I be thus knit and
married in our hearts together, it were well done, it seemeth,
that we should be knit <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par colletz et
jambes</span></i>”.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"
class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>It was becoming more and more evident that the only
hope for France was in a speedy alliance with England. The
Bishop of Tarbes, on his return from his embassy to solicit
Mary’s hand for his master, contributed his meed of praise,
assuring Francis that the Princess was “the pearl of the
world,” and “of such beauty and virtue that the King of
England esteemed her more than anything on earth”.</p>

<p>“I pray you, repeat unto me none of these matters,”
interrupted Francis impatiently. “I know well enow her
education, her form, her fashion, her beauty and virtue, and
what father and mother she cometh of; expedient and
necessary it shall be for me and for my realm that I marry
her, and I assure you for the same cause, I have as great
a mind to her as ever I had to any woman.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the alliance with England was not to be in
this wise. The army, consisting of 30,000 men, which Francis
had sent into Italy under Lautrec, had suffered a humiliating
defeat before Naples, and the loss of a second army at
Landriano obliged him to conclude with Charles the disastrous
treaty of Cambrai, by which he was forced to pay 2,000,000
of gold crowns in lieu of Burgundy. Four marriages were to
ensue. The King of France was to fulfil his promise to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Emperor’s sister; the Dauphin was to marry the Infanta of
Portugal; the son of the Duke of Lorraine was affianced to
the Princess Madeleine, daughter of the King of France,
whose second son, the Duke of Orleans, was betrothed to
Mary.</p>

<p>The marriage contract between Mary and the Duke of
Orleans, signed and sealed by Francis I., and illustrated with
their portraits, was dated 18th August 1527, and is still
preserved in the Record Office.<a name="FNanchor_62_62"
id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This interesting
document
is beautifully illuminated on vellum, with a gold background
and a border composed of Tudor roses, <i>fleurs de lys</i> and cupids.
Francis I., representing the god Hymen, in a dress of the
period, holds a hand of the bride and of the bridegroom.
The arms of England and France are on either side of
him. The Princess Mary, a youthful figure in a white dress
covered with flowers, and wearing a blue coif with a gold
border, stands on the left of Francis; the Duke of Orleans,
a young boy in doublet and trunk hose, is on his right.</p>

<p>The peace, thus momentarily secured at the cost of immense
sacrifices on the part of France, afforded a brief space
in which to prepare for a fresh outbreak of hostilities. Francis
and Henry were henceforth allies, and the course of affairs in
England tended to cement their bond, and to widen the breach
between them and the house of Austria. Henry sent Francis
the Garter, and received the order of St. Michael in exchange.<a name="FNanchor_63_63"

<p class="ac noindent">THE BEGINNING OF STRIFE.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">1527-1533.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mary’s</span> whole life was clouded, with the first whisper of the
King’s “secret matter”. Until then the Princess had been
surrounded with all the charm of greatness, without any of
its disadvantages, for she had been so wisely educated, that
she remained unspoiled by the adulation of courtiers, or by
the enthusiasm with which the nation regarded her. Her
delight was in study, in music, in almsgiving, in the bestowal
of gifts, and in the society of her parents, both of whom were
remarkable for talents above the average.<a name="FNanchor_64_64"
id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> She had been too
young to be greatly affected by the various schemes for her
disposal in marriage, although she had taken her betrothal
to the Emperor seriously; but her trials began when she was
old enough to appreciate their meaning, and when she might
reasonably have expected to realise some of the seductive
prospects held before her eyes from her cradle. There was
no element of romance in her character; her mental endowments
were essentially of a practical nature, and she
lacked almost entirely the gifts necessary to adapt them to a
changing world. Nearly all her life long the times were out
of joint, and she knew no other way to set them right, but
that of uncompromising opposition. But she possessed in
an eminent degree the virtues of her limitations; her whole
conduct was moulded on examples which she had been taught
to reverence as her conscience, and consistent to a fault, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
saw little evil in the old order, little good in the new.
Ardently affectionate, a loyal friend and bountiful mistress,
she was keenly sensitive to every act of fidelity. According
to the contemporary chronicle already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_65_65"
id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> “she was so
bred as she hated evil, knew no foul or unclean speeches,
which when her lord father understood, he would not believe
it, but would try it once by Sir Francis Brian, being at a mask
in the court; and finding it to be true notwithstanding, perceiving
her to be prudent, and of a princely spirit, did ever
after more honour her”.</p>

<p>But the fatal shadow of Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas
Boleyn, had fallen on the throne, and the king’s infatuation
for her was to sweep both his wife and his daughter into a
vortex of misery from which there was no escape for one of
them but death. Whether Wolsey first insinuated the doubt
as to the validity of the king’s marriage, in order to pander
to Henry’s wandering fancies, or whether Henry himself,
carried away by his passion for Anne Boleyn, evolved the
idea of a possible flaw in his union with Katharine, matters
little. The question was soon entangled in a mass of chicanery,
and whichever of the two may have been the first to strike
the match, it was clear to Wolsey, that his fortunes depended
henceforth on his keeping the flame alive. The subject had
been mooted as far back as 1525, and the first mention of the
coming divorce, of which we have any record, is contained in
a letter from Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, to Wolsey.
Referring to some other business, Warham says, “it will be
better not to proceed further, till this great matter of the King’s
grace be ended”.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66"
class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Again in 1526, after a long interval in
which the subject seems to have been dropped, the Bishop
of Bath and Wells remarked to the Cardinal of York, “there
will be great difficulty <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa istud benedictum
divortium</span></i>”.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>The sack of Rome by the Imperialists, and the Pope’s
captivity delayed the investigation of the cause by the papal
courts to which it had been referred, but in 1527, Henry’s
“scruples” for having married his brother’s widow began to
be talked of as the King’s “great,” “secret” or “private
matter”.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68"
class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Possibly, when Henry first began to study the Scriptures,
and the writers of antiquity in search of arguments to
support his “scruples,” he may not yet have fallen in love
with Anne, or at least Wolsey did not know that he had.
When he did set his mind on marrying her, it did not seem
probable that his fancy would outlive the necessary delays
and preliminaries of a divorce, even if it could be obtained,
or that the ambition of the Boleyns would be equal to the
influence of the Cardinal. But during Wolsey’s absence in
France, the whole subject assumed a point and a piquancy
hitherto undreamed of. Wolsey had not fostered Henry’s desires
in order to further his marriage with the grand-daughter
of a wealthy merchant. He himself aimed at nothing short
of the Papacy, and he thought that by negotiating a brilliant
marriage with a princess of France, he could make for himself
a convenient stepping-stone thereto, far more secure than that
which Mary’s marriage would afford. As the candidate of two
powerful monarchs, he would practically control the next conclave;
but the Boleyns could do nothing for him. He had yet
to learn that Anne was strong enough to work his ruin.</p>

<p>Before his departure for his embassy to France, he had,
in collusion with the King, held a secret legatine court, together
with Archbishop Warham, and had cited Henry to
appear, and answer the charge of having lived unlawfully for
eighteen years with his brother’s widow. A second sitting of
the court was held on the 20th May, and a third on the 31st.</p>

<p>Thus were the proceedings opened, but Henry, fearing that
the authority of the two archbishops might not be weighty
enough to bring the affair to a crisis, proposed that the question,
whether a man might marry his late brother’s wife,
should be submitted to the most learned bishops in England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
counting on their subserviency to obtain the answer he wished.
But the bishops were less amenable than he expected. Most
of them replied that with a papal dispensation such a marriage
would be perfectly valid.</p>

<p>All this time, Henry imagined that his secret had been
kept; but Katharine was well aware of what was pending.
On the 22nd June he broached the subject to her, telling her
that he had been living in mortal sin, and that henceforth
he would abstain from her company. He asked her to remove
to some place at a distance from the court. Katharine,
greatly agitated, burst into tears, and would neither admit
the reasonableness of his doubts nor agree to live apart
from him. In the actual state of affairs, Henry could do
no more, and for a time nothing was changed. Anne was
almost constantly at court, and the divorce was now openly
spoken of, but was extremely unpopular. No one believed in
Henry’s scruples, but Anne played her part with tact, and her
power increased daily. To give some colour to the proceedings,
Henry and Wolsey had trumped up an ingenious story.
They declared that during the treaty for Mary’s marriage
with Francis or the Duke of Orleans, the Bishop of Tarbes
had expressed a doubt as to her legitimacy.<a name="FNanchor_69_69"
id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This story was
made to do duty in England, but no trace of the Bishop of
Tarbes having made such a remark is to be found in France,
nor was any use made of the pretext in the subsequent trial
at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It is in distinct contradiction with the well-known
fact that the bishop was in favour of the marriage, and did all
he could to bring it about. Moreover, during all the long
and tedious discussions between the two kings at that time,
not a word transpired, even when Wolsey went to France, of
Henry’s intention to repudiate Katharine, not a doubt was
expressed of Mary’s legitimacy. Henry always alluded to
his daughter at that time as heiress to the throne. But on
Wolsey’s return, matters at once assumed a different aspect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Elated with the success of his embassy, the Cardinal of York
seemed to have the world at his feet. He had all but married
Mary to the King of France, who was in need of nothing
more than of England’s friendship. As soon as this union
was accomplished, Henry’s marriage might be successfully
broken, and a new one negotiated with a daughter of France,
when two grateful monarchs would hold the triple crown
over his expectant head. But now all this choice fabric
of his dreams was imperilled by the clashing ambition of a
woman, even then lightly spoken of. Anne, knowing that he
would be her bitterest foe, obtained to be present at his first
audience with the King, and shortly after, Henry told him
that he intended to marry her. Seeing that arguments, entreaties
and warnings were futile, Wolsey turned round and
paid court to the rising star. But Anne never forgave his
opposition, and never trusted him. She taunted Henry with
his bondage to the Cardinal, and did not rest till she had
stirred up strife between them, on the subject of the nomination
of an Abbess of Wilton. The quarrel was patched up,
but it proved to be the rift within the lute, that was to make
harmony impossible, and to lead on to his fall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mary was still in ignorance of the events that
were to influence all her future. Her education went on without
interruption, and in the summer of 1528, Katharine, who,
in spite of overwhelming anxieties, had room in her mind for
solicitude regarding her daughter’s studies, wrote to Ludovicus
Vives to express a wish that he would come and teach the
Princess Latin, during the following winter. He consented,
and returned to England on the 1st October, “to please the
King and Queen”. By this time Katharine was in dire need
of help, advice and consolation. “She told him how deeply
she was afflicted about the controversy concerning her marriage;
and, thinking him well read in matters of moral, began
to open out to him as her countryman, on the subject of her
grief.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71"
class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Vives prudently replied that “her sorrows were a proof
that she was dear to God, for that thus He was accustomed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
chasten His own”. But he proved himself a true friend to the
Queen, and took occasion to write to Henry, begging him to
consider the danger of his course in incurring the enmity of
the Emperor. If his object was to have a son, he might choose
a suitable person to marry his daughter. If he were to take
another wife, there was no certainty that she would bear him
a son, or that a son would live. A new marriage would leave
the succession doubtful, and afford grounds for civil war. He
was, he said, moved to write by his duty to the King, love to
England, where he was so kindly received, and anxiety for
the peace of Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_72_72"
id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Katharine had, in truth, need of patience. Anne grew
daily more overbearing, and it was hardly to be expected that
the Queen’s sense of humour should be equal to the grotesque
littleness, with which the favourite exulted over her enemies.
In a hapless moment she showed her contempt for them by
the device, <i>Ainsi sera, groigne qui groigne</i>, which she caused
to be embroidered on her servants’ liveries, but learned to her
mortification that she had unwittingly adopted the motto of
her bitter enemies, the princes of the house of Burgundy. In
England, the friends of the Queen cried: “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Groigne qui groigne
et vive Bourgoigne</span>!</i>” The liveries, being thus covered with
ridicule, had to be discarded, and on Christmas Day, her
servants appeared in their old doublets.<a name="FNanchor_73_73"
id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In October 1528, the papal legate, Cardinal Campeggio
arrived in London. The Pope had charged him with the mission
to do his utmost to restore mutual affection between
the King and Queen, and failing this result, to open a court
of inquiry, in conjunction with Wolsey.</p>

<p>But it was clear that no reconciliation would be possible.
Henry was infatuated with Anne; and as for the legatine
court, the two judges were at cross purposes, Wolsey aiming
at nothing but a verdict against the marriage, while Campeggio
was determined that justice should be done. His
policy was to counteract the haste with which the proceedings
were hurried forward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> “with great strides
always faster than
a trot,” and in this he succeeded so well, that the legates
being pressed to give sentence in the King’s favour by the
22nd July, Campeggio declared, that if Wolsey agreed with
him, he was willing to pronounce sentence, otherwise it would
not be pronounced. The cause was then removed to Rome,
to be tried before the Court of the Rota, and it being apparent
that Wolsey possessed neither weight nor credit with the
Pope, his fall became imminent. Anne had not schemed in
vain, and his disgrace filled her with exultation, although her
cause was in no way benefited by it.</p>

<p>We are greatly indebted for the history of the Queen and
the Princess Mary, during the next few years, to the interesting
despatches of the imperial ambassador, Eustace Chapuys,
who arrived in England in August 1529. He was a native of
Switzerland, aged about thirty, of distinguished, and even
courtly manners, eloquent, quick-witted and trustworthy.
Charles V. had been so much impressed with his sagacity
that he sent him as ambassador, first to Francis I., then to
Henry VIII., both enemies who required judicious handling.
Full of minute details, his letters cannot be said to present
either a wholly impartial, or still less a one-sided view of
passing events. Chapuys was an avowed friend of the unhappy
Queen and of her daughter, but as the accredited
envoy of Charles V. he would not be likely to furnish him
with false statements, or garbled facts, and although his
natural bias leads him to write with eulogy of the Queen
and the Princess, and with acrimony of their enemies, he
would not have been the diplomatist he proved himself to be
had he misled Charles as to the details of the tragedy that
was being played before his eyes. He was a shrewd observer,
tactful and discreet, so that he never compromised his
position at court by showing too much zeal. He contrived
to give Henry and Cromwell the impression that he was
acting solely as the Emperor’s diplomatic agent, and thus
was at first allowed to communicate freely with Katharine
and Mary, and was often able to render them important
service.</p>

<p>In transcribing portions of these letters, Dr. Gairdner’s excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
translations of the original documents in the Vienna
archives, and the versions of Don Pasquale de Gayangos
have been used. Mr. Rawdon Brown’s transcripts from the
Venetian archives are still important, and later on, of even
greater interest.</p>

<p>The condition in which Chapuys found the English Court
was unique. Henry continued to treat Katharine with outward
decency; they still sometimes dined together in public,
and occasionally hunted in each other’s company. But Anne
was never far off, and when at court, was treated with as
much ceremony as the Queen herself. Mary was seldom
allowed to visit her parents, probably because of Anne’s
intense dislike to her. The favourite was, perhaps not unnaturally,
less jealous of the wife whom Henry had ceased
to care for, than of the daughter whom he was supposed to
idolise. Both at Hampton Court and Windsor there was
ample accommodation for the Queen, and the mistress as
well; but at York Place, Whitehall, which Henry had seized
on Wolsey’s fall, there was no suitable apartment for
Katharine; and Anne was always best pleased to be there,
for then Henry left his wife at Greenwich. But the court
was seldom in London, and Anne agitated incessantly that
she might be banished.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In March 1531, Mary was allowed to visit her mother;
but in April she had an illness, and wrote to the King that
no medicine would do her so much good as to see him and
the Queen, and desired his permission to come to them both
at Greenwich. “This,” said Chapuys, “has been refused, to
gratify the Lady, who hates her as much as the Queen, or
more so, chiefly because she sees the King has some affection
for her. Of late, when the King praised her in the Lady’s
presence, the latter was very angry, and began to vituperate
the Princess very strangely. She becomes more arrogant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
every day, using words and authority towards the King, of
which he has several times complained to the Duke of
Norfolk, saying that she was not like the Queen, who had
never in her life used ill words to him.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75"
id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>On the 14th May, he writes: “The King, dining the other
day with the Queen, as is usual in most festivals, began to
speak of the Turk, and the truce concluded with your
Majesty, praising your puissance, contrary to his wont.
Afterwards, proceeding to speak of the Princess, he accused
the Queen of cruelty, because she had not made her physician
reside continually with her; and so the dinner passed off
amicably. Next day, when the Queen, in consequence of
these gracious speeches, asked the King to allow the Princess
to see them, he rebuffed her very rudely, and said she might
go and see the Princess if she wished, and also stop there.
The Queen graciously replied, that she would not leave him
for her daughter, nor for any one else in the world, and there
the matter stopped.”</p>

<p>Worried at the opposition which he encountered in his
efforts to get rid of Katharine, Henry told the Duke of
Norfolk that it would have been a great blessing if this
marriage had never been made, but on second thoughts, he
added, “nevertheless, this would have been a great pity,
since of it there had come such a pearl as the Princess, who
was one of the most beautiful and virtuous ladies of the
world”.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>In 1530, Mary was still called Princess of Wales, and
until the autumn of the following year, her father kept up an
appearance of civility towards her mother, visiting her in her
apartments every three days. At last, however, he left her
at Windsor, and went away hunting with Anne. Katharine
sent to inquire after his health, and he replied by an angry
letter, forbidding her to write to him. To add to the insult,
there was no address on the letter, “probably,” says Chapuys,
“because a change of name was contemplated; but the
Princess is with her, and this will make her forget her grief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
for the absence of the King. They amuse themselves by
hunting, and visiting the royal houses round Windsor, expecting
some good news from Rome.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77"
id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>Chapuys told the Emperor that the Pope had said, that
“if there was written evidence of the great familiarity and
scandalous conversation, and bad example of the King and
the Lady, and of the ill-treatment of the Queen, his Holiness
would immediately fulminate his censures”. But, by this
time, Henry was reckless of all save Anne, and his hunting
expedition having come to an end, he wished to return to
Windsor, and intimated to Katharine that both she and her
daughter must depart. Mary was to return to Richmond,
while she herself had orders to repair to the More, a house
in Hertfordshire, formerly belonging to Wolsey, but which
had come into the possession of the Abbey of St. Albans,
and was granted to the King, in December 1531. The house
itself is described as “a commodious habitation in summer,”
but the park and garden were in a ruinous condition and
“the ways so foul that those who went there in carriages,
broke down the pales and made highway through the park”.
The keeper, Sir John Russell, wrote repeatedly to Cromwell
about the condition of the said palings, but could get no
answer, and complained that if the king would “give no
money for the paling,” no deer would be left; and if the
charge were not so great, he would bear it out of his own
purse. Moreover, the king would only give the gardener
sixpence a day, and no one would take it at that price.
If he would give eightpence, Sir John declares that he himself
would contribute “twenty nobles of the charge”. “The
Queen’s servants, with their carriage, broke down the pales
in many places.”<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Katharine remained at this place for several months. She
declared that she would have preferred going to the Tower
as a prisoner, but Chapuys said that the King knew quite
well, that if he sent her there, the people would have risen in
mutiny; that he was often waylaid as he went to hunt, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
entreaties to take the Queen back, and that Anne met with
insults from the women wherever she went. Nevertheless,
she protested loudly, that the King would marry her in
three or four months, and began preparing for her royal
state.</p>

<p>Katharine never saw her daughter again, and could only
communicate with her secretly. They were sternly forbidden
to write to each other, whereupon Mary begged that some one
might be sent from the King to read the letters which she
wrote to her mother, that it might be seen she only informed
her about her health. But even this was refused, and henceforth
none but furtive missives passed between them, letters
written in dread, and conveyed with danger, at times when
exceptional terrors appeared to hang over the one or the
other. Henry hoped by a systematic persecution, to break
the spirit of both; but each was of the blood royal of Spain,
the noblest in Europe, and the indignities heaped upon them
only served to increase the dignity with which they suffered.
Mary was, moreover, a Tudor also, and could be as resolute
as her father.</p>

<p>In 1531, an Italian, Mario Savagnano, with some companions,
paid a visit to the English Court, and in an interesting
account of his journey recorded his impressions of the King,
Queen, and Princess:—</p>

<p>“I saw the King twice, and kissed his hand; he is glad to
see foreigners, and especially Italians; he embraced me
joyously, and then went out to hunt with some forty to fifty
horsemen. He is tall of stature, very well formed and of
very handsome presence, beyond measure affable, and I
never saw a prince better disposed than this one. He is also
learned and accomplished, and most generous and kind, and
were it not that he now seeks to repudiate his wife, after
having lived with her for twenty-two years, he would be no less
perfectly good, and equally prudent. But this thing detracts
greatly from his merits, as there is now living with him a
young woman of noble birth, though many say of bad
character, whose will is law to him, and he is expected to
marry her should the divorce take place, which it is supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
will not be effected, as the peers of the realm, both spiritual
and temporal, are opposed to it; nor during the present
Queen’s life will they have any other queen in the kingdom.
Her Majesty is prudent and good; and during these
differences with the King, she has evinced constancy and resolution,
never being disheartened or depressed. I returned
to Windsor Castle, and from thence, on the fourth day of my
departure from London, arrived at a palace called the More,
where the Queen resides. In the morning we saw her
Majesty dine: she had some thirty maids of honour standing
round the table, and about fifty who performed its service.
Her court consists of about two hundred persons, but she is
not so much visited as heretofore, on account of the King.
Her Majesty is not of tall stature, rather small. If not handsome,
she is not ugly; she is somewhat stout, and has always
a smile on her countenance. We next went to another palace
called Richmond, where the Princess her daughter resides;
and having asked the maggiordomo for permission to see her,
he spoke to the chamberlain, and then to the governess (the
Countess of Salisbury) and they made us wait. Then, after
seeing the palace, we returned to the hall, and having entered
a spacious chamber, where there were some venerable old
men, with whom we discoursed, the Princess came forth, accompanied
by a noble lady, advanced in years, who is her
governess, and by six maids of honour. This Princess is not
tall, has a pretty face, and is well proportioned, with a very
beautiful complexion, and is fifteen years old. She speaks
Spanish, French, and Latin, besides her own mother-English
tongue, is well grounded in Greek, and understands Italian,
but does not venture to speak it. She sings excellently, and
plays on several instruments, so that she combines every accomplishment.
We were then taken to a sumptuous repast,
after which we returned to our lodging, whither, according
to the fashion of the country, the Princess sent us a present of
wine and ale (which last is another beverage of theirs) and
white bread. On the next day, which was the 6th, we returned
to London to the house of our ambassador, where we
remained two days, and then by boat went down the Thames,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
which is very broad, and covered with swans, and thus we got
to Dover the passage port.”<a name="FNanchor_79_79"

    at Strawberry Hill.</div>
</div>

<p>Another Italian visitor, the Venetian, Ludovico Falier,
describes Mary at sixteen years old as “a very handsome,
amiable and accomplished princess, in no respect inferior to
her mother”. He remarks that Katharine was so much loved
and respected, that the people were beginning to murmur
against the King. “Were,” he continues, “the faction to
produce a leader, it is certain that the English nation, so prone
to innovation and change, would take up arms for the Queen,
and by so much the more, were it arranged for the leader to
marry the Princess Mary, although by English law females
are excluded from the Crown.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80"
id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Another, Marin Giustinian, writing to the Signory, says:
“The English King is not popular with his subjects, chiefly
on account of his intention to divorce his wife, who is much
loved, and they hold her daughter in very great account”.<a name="FNanchor_81_81"
id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>A month later, the same writer was at Paris, and says:—</p>

<p>“The English ambassador here, Sir John Wallop, does
not approve the divorce; praising the wisdom, innocence, and
patience of Queen Katharine, as also her daughter. He says
that the Queen was beloved as if she had been of the blood
royal of England, and the Princess in like manner.”<a name="FNanchor_82_82"
id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>And from Lyons, on the 28th March 1533, he writes that
a gentleman who has come from England has told Sir John
Wallop, that “the King does not choose the Princess any longer
to be styled Princess, but ‘Madam Mary,’ nor will he give
her in marriage abroad; others say that he intends to make
her a nun”. In August Marc Antonio Venier, in a despatch
to the Signory from Rome, says that “letters from England
announce that the Archbishop of Canterbury has pronounced
a sentence in favour of Henry, prohibiting Katharine to be
any longer named Queen, and is having it proclaimed throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the realm, so that she may not be able to defend herself;
and her daughter has been admonished not to interfere”.<a name="FNanchor_83_83"
id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>In the main, the Italians were correctly informed as
to passing events in England. But at this period, although
Henry kept Mary at a distance from court, and had not
seen her for three years, she was still treated with a degree
of consideration, to which her mother had long been a
stranger. He was still uncertain as to the use he would
make of her, in securing for himself allies abroad. He
hoped that she would submit quietly to the new laws, and
therefore, for a time at least, nothing was abated of her
royal state. In September 1531, soon after her parting
from her mother, a warrant was issued to the Master of the
Great Wardrobe “to deliver certain things for the use of
the Princess,” nearly all of which were composed of materials
then only used by royal personages.<a name="FNanchor_84_84"
id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The perennial question of her marriage was again in
debate, but was thenceforth removed to a lower level in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
European politics. Her betrothal to the Duke of Orleans
had never been cancelled, but a dispute had arisen between
Henry and Francis, on the subject of money. Then, when
the validity of her parents’ marriage became a matter of
discussion in all the Universities of Europe, Francis wished
that the case should be first settled, “lest the world should
declare that his son had married a bastard”.<a name="FNanchor_85_85"
id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> And in the
midst of these delays, the Scottish alliance was again mooted.
But the Scotch put too high a value on their friendship with
France, to risk such a union;<a name="FNanchor_86_86"
id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Margaret
was too like her
brother to commit herself to any definite policy save that
of intrigue; and Henry had now more urgent business on
hand than the disposal of his daughter in marriage. Some
languid interest was excited at court by the proposal of
King John Zapolski to marry her, and Chapuys heard that
her hand had been sought for the Duke of Cleves;<a name="FNanchor_87_87"
id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> but
neither project was seriously entertained. It was also believed
that the Pope and the Emperor wished to bestow her
on Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, who had lost the use
of his hands and feet. “And this,” wrote Niño to the
Emperor, “would not be half such bad treatment of the
daughter as of the mother.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88"
id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>To all these projects Henry replied that the Princess
would never be married except in a high position, for she
was still heiress of the kingdom; and when the great affair was
settled in the King’s favour, and he remarried, it was uncertain
whether he would have male children, and if not she would be
preferred to other daughters. If any person ventured to say
that she was illegitimate, “he would have his head cut off”.<a name="FNanchor_89_89"

<p>Wolsey had died in disgrace, on the 27th November
1530, and the chancellorship devolved on his own secretary,
Thomas Cromwell, a man who virtually made the history of
the next ten years in England. The son of a “fuller of
clothes” or dyer, his career had been singularly varied. He
had as a mere youth found his way to Italy, where he served
as a common soldier, but being preternaturally observant,
he succeeded in picking up many scraps of the new learning
which fell from the great Medici banquet, then being spread
throughout Tuscany. Machiavelli’s book, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Principe</span></i>,
was the foundation on which his whole future statesmanship was
built. On his return to England he was successively a
scrivener, a lawyer, a money-lender, and a great wool
merchant at Middlesbrough. It was not till he was nearly
middle-aged, that he attracted the notice of Wolsey, then
beginning the suppression of some small monasteries, in
favour of his colleges at Ipswich and Oxford. On Wolsey’s
fall, it was thought that he would be imprisoned, but he seized
the moment when the tide was turning, and used it to float
himself into a safe harbour. Reginald Pole, son of the
Countess of Salisbury, had met him at Cardinal Wolsey’s,
and had recognised in him the coming man. They had
talked philosophy, and Cromwell tried to persuade him that
Plato’s system was “a dream,” promising to send him a copy
of <i>Il Principe</i>. It was probably at Cromwell’s instigation
that Henry offered Pole the Archbishopric of York, although
he was not yet in priest’s orders. Seeing the course that the
King was now taking, and Cromwell’s growing influence,
instead of accepting the benefice, Pole determined to fly
the kingdom, “beyond the reach of his bow,”<a name="FNanchor_90_90"
id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and was in
consequence saved from the fate of More and Fisher, and,
later on, from that of his own mother. Henry, loth to lose
so able an advocate as he would prove, if he could be won
over to his cause, refused his repeated request to be allowed
to go and study abroad. But at last Pole told him that if
he remained in England, he must of necessity attend the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Parliament which was about to assemble, and that if the
King’s divorce were discussed, he must speak according to
his conscience. Henry then at once gave him leave to go,
and even promised to continue his income of 400 ducats
yearly.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91"
class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Between the beginning of August 1530 and May 1531,
Henry lavished the price of a king’s ransom in jewels upon
Anne.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92"
class="fnanchor">[92]</a> But in the catalogue of presents made by him on
New Year’s Day, 1532, the names of the Queen and Princess
are conspicuously followed by a blank space. Not only did
he send them none, but he forbade the members of his
council, and others to do so, and this year he abstained
for the first time from making presents to the ladies of
Katharine’s and Mary’s households. But to Anne he gave the
hangings of a room in cloth of gold and silver, and crimson
satin with costly embroideries. She was now lodged in the
Queen’s apartments, and had almost as many ladies as if she
were already queen. Katharine sent a gold cup to the King
as a present, but he returned it to her, with a message
praising its beauty, but informing her that he could receive
no gift from her. So complete was the power of Anne over
him at this time, that he was less free than the least of his
subjects; and this power she continued to exercise during
the entire year then beginning, and a few months longer.
Chapuys told the Emperor that one day Henry had met his
daughter walking in the fields, but did not say much to
her, except to ask her how she was, and to assure her that
in future he would see her more often. “It is certain,” he
continued, “that the King dares [not] bring her where the
Lady is, for she does not wish to see her or hear of her.”
He thought that the King would have talked with Mary
longer and more familiarly, if the Lady had not sent two
of her people to listen. The Princess, he adds, was to be
at Windsor during her father’s absence in France, whither
he was to be accompanied by Anne, and the Queen was very
much afraid that he would marry his mistress at the impending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
interview with the French king. “But the Lady has
assured some person in whom she trusts, that even if the
King wished, she would not consent, for she wishes it to be
done here, in the place where queens are wont to be married
and crowned.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93"
class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>In anticipation of the journey to France, Anne had been
created Marchioness of Pembroke on the 1st September 1532,<a name="FNanchor_94_94"
id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
and was to appear at the meeting with Francis, in great state
as the future queen; but as no royal lady could be prevailed
on to meet her, not even the Queen of Navarre, who was
supposed to be her friend, she was obliged to go unattended
by a suite.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>She accompanied Henry to Calais, and remained there
while he proceeded to join Francis at Boulogne. The two
Kings returned together to Calais, and Francis presented
Anne with a valuable jewel, complimenting her much on
her beautiful dancing. But all this was humiliation compared
with the ambitious hopes she had founded on the meeting,
and she was more than ever impatient for her marriage, when
she imagined that slights would no longer be her portion.</p>

<p>Warham had died on the 23rd August, and Cranmer, already
prominent as a creature of Henry’s and of the Boleyns,
and a zealous favourer of the divorce, was at once put forward
as a candidate for the vacant see of Canterbury. His election
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
was pushed on, in the hope that if the Pope gave an adverse
sentence, the new archbishop might then dissolve the King’s
marriage by his own authority. But some time must necessarily
elapse before the bulls of consecration could be issued, and
meanwhile matters were precipitated by Anne’s announcement
in January 1533, that Henry might expect an heir to the Crown.
It was necessary, if this passionately hoped-for heir was to be
Prince of Wales, that Henry and Anne should be married at
once.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"
class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The ceremony was accordingly performed at York
Place, on the 25th January, by Rowland Lee, one of the King’s
chaplains, whom Henry deceived with the assurance that he
had leave from the Pope to contract a new marriage. The
event was at first kept secret even from Cranmer, who was
informed of it a fortnight later, but Chapuys, ever vigilant and
alert, discovered that it had taken place, and informed the
Emperor, naming the date as the Feast of the Conversion
of St. Paul.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The object of the secrecy was twofold; first,
in order that a semblance of friendship might be kept up
with the Pope till he had granted Cranmer’s bulls, and also
that the date of the marriage might be afterwards falsified
to claim legitimacy for Anne’s child.<a name="FNanchor_98_98"
id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The bulls arrived in March, and Cranmer was immediately
consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury. The next step was
to pronounce sentence of divorce. A court was opened at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Dunstable, on the 10th May, and the Queen cited to appear
before it. On her failing to do so, Cranmer declared her
contumacious, and on the 23rd, proceeded to pronounce her
marriage null, Henry himself dictating the form of the
sentence.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99"
class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Katharine, when she was informed of this proceeding,
was at Ampthill, near Dunstable, whither she had been
removed from Buckden or Bugden, a house which she had
occupied for some months, very inferior to the More, and
very damp in winter, belonging to Longland, Bishop of
Lincoln, one of the first promoters of the divorce. Since
her arrival at Ampthill, Henry had twice sent to her to
inform her of his marriage with Anne, and to forbid her
any longer to take the title of Queen. She was henceforth
to be styled Princess Dowager, to retire to one of the houses
settled on her by his brother, Prince Arthur, and live on a
small income, as the King would no longer pay her expenses,
or the wages of her servants. She answered on both occasions
with calmness and dignity, that as long as she lived she would
call herself Queen, but that if the King objected to the expense
of her allowance, she would be contented with what she had,
and with her confessor, physician, apothecary and two women,
would go wherever he wished. If food for herself and servants
failed her, she would go and beg for the love of God.<a name="FNanchor_100_100"
id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Anne was now triumphant. Her coronation was fixed for
the 1st June, and the nearer she approached to the desired
goal, the more insolent became her conduct and language.<a name="FNanchor_101_101"
id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
Already, on the 10th April, Chapuys had written with great
earnestness to the Emperor, urging him to make war upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Henry, considering the very great injury done to madame,
his aunt, “for it is to be feared,” so ran the letter, “that the
moment this accursed Anne sets her foot firmly in the stirrup
she will try to do the Queen all the harm she possibly can,
and the Princess also, which is the thing your aunt dreads
most. Indeed, I hear she has lately boasted that she will
make of the Princess a maid-of-honour in her royal household,
that she may perhaps give her too much dinner on some
occasion, or marry her to some varlet, which would be an
irreparable evil.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102"
class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>In another part of the same letter he says: “I hear that
the King is about to forbid every one, under pain of death, to
speak in public or private, in favour of the Queen. After that,
he will most likely proceed to greater extremities, unless God
and your Majesty prevent it. Again, I beseech your Majesty
to forgive me if I dare give advice in such matters, for besides
the above causes, the great pity I have for the Queen and the
Princess, your Majesty’s aunt and niece (<i>sic</i>), absolutely compel
me to take this course. Though the King is by nature kind
and generously inclined, this Anne has so perverted him, that
he does not seem the same man. It is therefore to be feared
that unless your Majesty applies a prompt remedy to this evil,
the Lady will not relent in her persecution, until she actually
finishes with Queen Katharine, as she once did with Cardinal
Wolsey, whom she did not hate half so much. The Queen,
however, is not afraid for herself; what she cares most for is
the Princess.”</p>

<p>And again, in the same letter: “The Queen is to take the
title of old dowager Princess. As for the Princess Mary, no
title has been yet given to her,” and Chapuys fancies that they
will wait to settle this until “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la dame aye faict
lenfant</span></i>”.<a name="FNanchor_103_103"
id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Anne’s coronation in Westminster Abbey, magnificent as
a ceremony and a procession, was marked by an absence of
popular enthusiasm amounting to general stupefaction. The
crowd, silent and sullen, could not be persuaded to take off
their hats and cry “God save the Queen,” and when one of
Anne’s attendants told the lord mayor to order them to
cheer as usual, he answered that he “could not command
people’s hearts, and even the King could not do so”. The
court and the nobility did their best to grace the ceremony,
but the Duchess of Norfolk refused to be present, and no
one was surprised, for her loyalty to Queen Katharine was
known.</p>

<p>Henry had caused his own and Anne’s initials, H. and A.,
to be interwoven in every imaginable device, but the people
interpreted them derisively—Ha! ha! They even went so
far as to insult the French ambassador and his suite, because
they were known to be Anne’s friends, calling them
“French dogs”.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104"
class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>When Katharine left Ampthill to return to Buckden, all
the neighbourhood turned out to do her honour. In defiance
of the order not to style her queen, they shouted at the top of
their voices: “Long live Queen Katharine,” wishing her joy,
repose, and prosperity, and confusion to her enemies. They
begged her with tears, to set them to work and employ them
in her service, protesting that they were ready to die for her.<a name="FNanchor_105_105"
id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
A few days before, Henry had sent Lord Mountjoy, her
chamberlain, and several other gentlemen to Ampthill, to tell
her once more that she must henceforth bear the title of
Dowager-Princess of Wales. But she declared that she would
never accept service from any one, or answer any one who
addressed her by that title. On being shown the report of
the interview with her, which had been drawn up by the
deputation, she crossed out the words <i>Dowager-Princess</i>
wherever they appeared.</p>

<p>The news of Henry’s independent action, and of Cranmer’s
sentence at Dunstable, had duly reached the Pope’s ears, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
had brought the cause before the Rota<a name="FNanchor_106_106"
id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> to a sudden climax.
A brief was at once issued, declaring that Cranmer, and all
those who had co-operated with him in the matter, had incurred
the greater excommunication, and the Papal anathemas were
prepared. Henry appealed from the authority of the Pope
to a General Council, and withdrew his ambassador from
Rome. It was the beginning of the breach with the Pope.</p>

<p>On the 7th September, Anne gave birth to a daughter, and
Chapuys wrote to Charles: “The Lady’s daughter has been
christened Elizabeth, not Mary as I wrote in my last despatch.
The christening ceremony was as dull and disagreeable (<i>mal
playcante</i>) as the mother’s coronation. Neither at court nor
at this city of London nor elsewhere have there been bonfires,
illuminations, and rejoicings customary on such occasions.
Immediately after the christening of this daughter of the King
a herald, standing at the gate of the church, proclaimed her
Princess of England; and previously to that, that is, immediately
after the child’s birth, the same herald announced that the
good, true, and legitimate Princess (of Wales) was no longer
to be called so; the badges usually borne by her laquais on
their coats-of-arms were instantly removed, and replaced by
the King’s skutcheon. In fact, a rumour is afloat, and not
without foundation, that her household and allowance are to
be shortly reduced. <i>May God in His infinite mercy prevent a
still worse treatment.</i> Meanwhile, the Princess, prudent and
virtuous as she naturally is, has taken all these things with
patience, trusting entirely in God’s mercy and goodness. She
has addressed to her mother, the Queen, a most wonderful
letter, full of consolation and comfort. I shall not fail, however,
after hearing the Queen’s wishes, and receiving her
orders, to remonstrate and protest against so enormous an
injury and injustice, as the one just inflicted upon her and
her daughter, the Princess, though I very much fear—and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
indeed am almost sure—that all my remonstrances will lead
to nothing, for certainly, the King’s obdurate sin, and his own
misfortune have so shut his ears that no arguments of any
sort or prayers shall be listened to. Indeed, something more
than mere words will be required to make him return to the
right path.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>But Anne would allow of no respite in the persecution of
Henry’s wife and daughter, and the King was now committed
to a systematic policy, by which they were to be reduced to
submission. A document now in the Record Office, endorsed
“Articles to be proposed to my lady Mary,” marks the next
act of the drama. They are as follows: “Articles to be
proponed and showed on our behalf unto our daughter, lady
Mary, and all other the officers and servants of her household,
by our right trusty and right well-beloved cousin and
councillors, the earls of Oxford, Essex and Sussex, and by
our trusty and right well-beloved clerk and councillor, the
Dean of our Chapel, whom we send at this time unto our
said daughter.</p>

<p>“1. They are to assemble on Wednesday next, at Chemsforth
(Chelmsford) and after communicating with each other
on their charge, repair to Beaulieu (New Hall) where our
said daughter now abides, and there declare their credence
as follows, by the mouth of the Dean of the Chapel, <i>viz.</i>:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>“2. That the King is surprised to be informed both by
lord Husaye’s letters, and by his said daughter’s own, delivered
by one of her servants, that she, forgetting her filial
duty and allegiance, attempts, in spite of the commandment
given her by lord Hussy, and by the letters of Sir Will.
Pallett, controller of the Household, arrogantly to usurp the
title of Princess, pretending to be heir apparent, and encourages
to do the like, declaring that she cannot in conscience,
think but she is the King’s lawful daughter, born in
true matrimony, and believes the King in his own conscience
thinks the same. That to prevent her pernicious example
spreading, they have been commanded to declare to her the
folly and danger of her conduct, and how the King intends
that she shall use herself henceforth, both as to her title and
as to her household. That she has worthily deserved the
King’s high displeasure and punishment by law, but that on
her conforming to his will, he may incline of his fatherly pity
to promote her welfare.”</p>

<p>Mary had thus written to her father on the 2nd October:—</p>

<p>“This morning my chamberlain came and informed me
that he had received a letter from Sir Will. Paulet, controller
of your House, to the effect that I should remove at
once to Hertford Castle.</p>

<p>“I desired to see the letter, in which was written ‘the
lady Mary, the King’s daughter,’ leaving out the name of
Princess. I marvelled at this, thinking your Grace was not
privy to it, not doubting but you take me for your lawful
daughter, born in true matrimony. If I agreed to the contrary,
I should offend God; in all other things, you shall find
me an obedient daughter. From your manor of Beaulieu,
2 Oct.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108"
class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>On the 16th, the imperial ambassador again writes:—</p>

<p>“Nothing new has occurred since the date of my last
despatch, except that the King has made the Princess, his
daughter, move from the fine house in which she was dwelling
to a very wretched one, most unfit for this present season.
He has done still more, the Princess’s residence he has given,
or let—I cannot say which—to lord Rochefort, the brother of
the Lady, who is already furnishing it, and sending thither his
household servants. I omitted in my last despatch to specify
all the names of those who had gone, by the King’s commands,
to speak to the Princess. These were: the earls of Auffort
(Oxford), Excez (Essex), and Succez (Sussex), and Dr.
Sampson, all of whom tried by prayers, threats and persuasions
innumerable, to make her give up the name and title
of Princess, and submit entirely to her father’s will, in this
respect, as God commands. But the Princess, I am told,
replied so wisely and discreetly, that the said lords knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
not what to say, and all shed tears in consequence (et ny
eust personne a la compagnie que ne pleurast bien chauldement).
And I hear also, that following her mother’s example,
she would never consent to hear them in private;
but insisted on their delivering the King’s message in public,
and before all her household assembled for the purpose. She
was no doubt afraid, as she has since declared, that in the
absence of witnesses, the King’s deputies might make some
statement to her prejudice or disadvantage. It is impossible
for me to describe the love and affection which the English
bear to their Princess; but they are already so much accustomed
to see and tolerate such disorderly things, that they
tacitly commit the redress of the same to God, and to your
Majesty.“</p>

<p>It was about this time, that Katharine, upon the warning
she had received from Chapuys, wrote the following letter to
Mary:—</p>

<p>“Daughter, I heard such tidings to-day, that I do perceive,
if it is true, the time is come that Almighty God will
prove you; and I am very glad of it, for I trust He doth
handle you with a good love. I beseech you, agree to His
pleasure with a merry heart; and be you sure, that without fail,
He will not suffer you to perish, if you beware to offend Him.
I pray you, good daughter, to offer yourself to Him. If any
pangs come to you,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109"
class="fnanchor">[109]</a> shrive yourself; first make you clean;
take heed of His commandments, and keep them as near as
He will give you grace to do, for then are you sure armed.
And if this lady do come to you, as it is spoken, if she do
bring you a letter from the King, I am sure, in the self-same
letter, you shall be commanded what you shall do. Answer
you with few words, obeying the King your father in everything,
save that you will not offend God, and lose your own
soul; and go no further with learning and disputation in the
matter. And wheresoever and in whatsoever company you
shall come, [obey] the King’s commandments. Speak you
few words, and meddle nothing. I will send you two books
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
in Latin: one shall be <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Vita Christi</span></i>,
with the declaration
of the Gospels, and the other the <i>Epistles of Hierome</i>, that he
did write always to St. Paula and Eustochium; and in them
I trust you shall see good things. And sometimes, for your
recreation, use your virginals, if you have any. But one
thing specially I desire you, for the love you do owe unto
God, and unto me, to keep your heart with a chaste mind,
and your body from all ill and wanton company, [not] thinking
nor desiring any husband, for Christ’s Passion; neither
determine yourself to any manner of living, until this troublesome
time be past, for I dare make you sure that you shall
see a very good end, and better than you can desire. I would
God, good daughter, that you did know with how good a
heart I do write this letter unto you. I never did one with a
better, for I perceive very well that God loveth you. I beseech
Him of His goodness to continue it; and if it fortune
that you shall have nobody to be with you of your acquaintance,
I think it best to keep your keys yourself, for howsoever
it is, so shall be done as shall please them. And now you
shall begin, and by likelihood I shall follow. I set not a rush
by it; for when they have done the uttermost they can, then
I am sure of the amendment. I pray you recommend me
unto my good lady Salisbury, and pray her to have a good
heart, for we never come to the Kingdom of Heaven but by
troubles. Daughter, wheresoever you become, take no pain
to send for (to?) me, for if I may I will send to you.</p>

It was reported that Wolsey, having been told by a fortune-teller that his
ruin would be wrought through a woman, thought that woman to be Queen
Katharine, and that in order to prevent her from being his undoing, he determined
to bring her low. He put it into the head of the King’s confessor to suggest to
him that he had committed sin in marrying his brother’s wife (Vatican Archives,
Record Office transcripts, Bliss, portfolio 53).</p></div>

Mr. Friedmann considers (vol. i., p. 163) that this was the moment when
Anne became Henry’s mistress; but the love-letters which the King addressed

Chapuys writes that: Not content
with having given her all his own jewels, Henry sent the Duke of Norfolk to try
to obtain the Queen’s also. Katharine replied “that she would not send jewels
or anything else to the King, as he had long ago forbidden her to do so; and
besides, it was against her conscience to give her jewels to adorn a person who
was the scandal of Christendom, and a disgrace to the King who was taking her
to such an assembly; however, if the King sent expressly to ask for them, she
would obey him in this as in other things. Though he was vexed at what she
said, he did not fail to send for them by one of his own chamber, who had
letters to the Queen’s chancellor and chamberlain as well as to herself. The
man told her, the King was surprised that she had not sent her jewels, as the
Queen of France and many others had done. She excused herself, and sent all
she had; with which the King was much pleased” (Gairdner, <i>Cal.</i>, v., 1377).</p></div>

Sanders, Hall, and those who follow them, assert without the least
authority, that the marriage of Elizabeth’s parents took place in the preceding
November. Chapuys was himself mistaken, in asserting that Cranmer had
solemnised it. He was also wrong in ascribing the fact to Dr. Brown, Prior of
the Austin Friars in London. A letter from Cranmer to N. Hawkins, in the
following June, disclaims any part taken by himself in the marriage, which he
says took place “about St. Paul’s Day” (<i>Archæologia</i>, p. 81). Stowe makes
the following statement: “King Henry privilie married the Lady Anne Boleine
on the five and twentieth day of January, being S. Paules Day. Mistress Anne
Savage bore uppe Queene Anne’s traine, and was herself shortly after marryed
to the lord Barkley; doctor Rowland Lee that marryed the King to Queene
Anne was made Bishop of Chester, then Bishop of Coventry and Litchfield,
and president of Wales” (<i>Annals</i>, p. 561). Harpsfield’s account (in <i>The
Pretended Divorce</i>) is the same, with more detail, as is also Le Grand’s translation
from a Latin MS. in his <i>Histoire du Divorce</i> (vol. ii., p. 110).</p></div>

She took the Queen’s barge, and caused Katharine’s arms painted on it to
be mutilated. She then appropriated it to herself, and used it for her triumphal
progress up the river from Greenwich, on the eve of her coronation. “God
grant,” said Chapuys, “she may content herself with the said barge, and the
jewels and husband of the Queen, without attempting anything, as I have
heretofore written, against the persons of the Queen and Princess.” In the same
letter he quotes Cromwell’s remarks on the great modesty and patience of the
Queen, “not only now, but before the divorce, the King being continually inclined
to amours” (Gairdner, <i>Cal.</i>, vi., 556).</p></div>

As the time approached, Anne’s exultation overcame every remnant of
decency and good feeling: “The Lady not being satisfied with what she has
received already, has solicited the King to ask the Queen for a very rich triumphal
cloth, which she brought from Spain, to wrap up her children with at baptism,
which she would be glad to make use of very soon. The Queen has replied that
it has not pleased God she should be so ill advised as to grant any favor, in a
case so horrible and abominable” (Gairdner, <i>Cal.</i>, vi., 918).</p></div>

The tribunal of the Rota has the first place among the tribunals of the

which they are to try they receive from him by special commission. To the

<p><span class="smcap">A crisis</span> of some sort was
generally thought to be at hand,
although its precise nature remained a mystery for a few
days longer. The King’s subjects made no secret of their
satisfaction, because Anne had not fulfilled the confident
prognostications of the astrologers, who had flattered her
with assurances that she would present Henry with a son.
Not only did they rejoice in her disappointed ambition, and
in the visible cooling of Henry’s passion, but they now began
to entertain hopes that Mary would not be so completely set
aside in the succession as they had been led to expect.</p>

<p>The satisfaction and the hope were, however, short-lived,
and on the 3rd November, Chapuys communicated to the
Emperor the further untoward progress of events.<a name="FNanchor_111_111"
id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>“Not satisfied with having taken away from his own
legitimate daughter the name and title of princess, as intimated
in a former despatch, the King has lately been talking
of removing—and has actually begun to do so—all the
officers and servants of her princely household, on the plea
that they have encouraged her in her disobedience. This
the King has done, as he says, to daunt and intimidate her;
he has even gone so far as to demand that she (the Princess)
should go and live as ‘demoiselle d’honneur’ to his bastard
daughter, at which, your Majesty may guess, both the Queen
and the Princess are marvellously disturbed, and in great
trouble. They sent to me a week ago in this emergency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
and begged I would speak to Cromwell, and see what could
be done to arrest the blow. I immediately sent to the
Princess, a protest drawn in due form for her to sign and
keep secret, declaring that neither by word nor deed, expressly
nor tacitly, had she ever consented to anything that
may prejudice her or her right. I have besides put down
in writing several candid and temperate statements, to be
addressed to those who might come with such a proposition
in her father’s name. In case however, of there being no
help at all, she was, I said, to have patience, for she would
not have to suffer long. Should the King send some one
to her on such an errand, she was to say from the very first,
that if the King her father wished it to be so, she submitted,
but that she protested, in due form, against whatever might
be done to her prejudice. These words I wrote down for her,
she was to learn them by heart, and repeat them daily,
surrounded by her most confidential servants.”</p>

<p>The blow fell speedily, and on the 16th December, Chapuys
told his master that what he had feared had come to pass:<a name="FNanchor_112_112"
id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>—</p>

<p>“According to the determination come to by the King
about the treatment of the Princess and the bastard, of
which I wrote in my last, the said bastard was taken three
days ago to a house seventeen miles from here [Hatfield],
and although there was a shorter and better road, yet
for greater solemnity, and to insinuate to the people that
she is the true Princess, she was taken through this town
[London] with the company which I wrote in my last; and
next day, the Duke of Norfolk went to the Princess, to tell
her that her father desired her to go to the court and
service of the said bastard, whom he named Princess.
The Princess answered that the title belonged to herself, and
to no other, making many very wise remonstrances, that
what had been proposed to her was strange and dishonourable.
To which, the Duke could not reply. After much
talk, he said he had not come there to dispute, but to
accomplish the King’s will; and the Princess, seeing that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
was needless excusing herself, demanded half an hour’s
respite to go to her chamber, where she remained about that
time—to make, as I know, a protestation which I had sent
her, in order that if compelled by force or fraud to renounce
her rights, or enter a nunnery, it might not be to her
prejudice. On returning from her chamber, she said to the
Duke, that since the King her father was so pleased, she would
not disobey him, begging him to intercede with the King
for the recompense of her servants, that they might have at
least a year’s wages. She then asked what company she
should bring. The Duke said it was not necessary to bring
much, for she would find plenty where she was going; and
so she parted, with a very small suite. Her gouvernante
[the Countess of Salisbury], daughter of the late Duke of
Clarence and near kinswoman to the King, a lady of virtue
and honor, if there be one in England, has offered to follow
and serve her at her own expense, with an honorable train.
But it was out of the question that this would be accepted;
for in that case, they would have no power over the Princess,
whom it is to be feared, they mean to kill, either with grief
or otherwise, or make her renounce her right, or marry
basely, or make her stain her honour, to have ground for
disinheriting her—since notwithstanding the remonstrances I
have hitherto made, touching the Princess, to which I have
had no reply, the King has proceeded to such excesses; and
considering that my words only served to irritate him, and
make him more fierce and obstinate, I have resolved not
again to address to him a single word, except he obliges me,
without a command from the Queen.”</p>

<p>In the same letter he says:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>
<p>“You cannot imagine the grief of all the people at this
abominable government. They are so transported with
indignation at what passes, that they complain that your
Majesty takes no steps in it, and I am told by many
respectable people, that they would be glad to see a fleet
come hither in your name, to raise the people; and if they
had any chief among themselves, who dared raise his head,
they would require no more.”</p>

<p>After signing the formal protest which Chapuys had
drawn up for her, Mary allowed herself to be placed in a
litter, and conveyed to Hatfield, where Elizabeth, then three
months old, was provided with an establishment. Dr. Fox,
the King’s almoner, rode by the side of the litter, in order
to guard the Princess, and prevent any excessive outbreak
of indignation on the part of the populace. Nevertheless,
according to Anne’s scornful remark, Mary was treated, in
the villages through which she passed, “as if she were God
Himself who had descended from heaven”. Moreover, Dr.
Fox, Henry’s own agent, took the opportunity of telling
her that she had done well, not to submit, and he implored
her for the love of God, and the welfare of the realm, to
remain firm.</p>

<p>On the 23rd December, Chapuys continues his narrative:<a name="FNanchor_113_113"
id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>“When the Princess, who was taken off with only two
attendants, had arrived where the bastard was, the Duke (of
Suffolk) asked her whether she would not go and pay her
respects to the Princess. She replied, that she knew no other
Princess in England except herself, and that the daughter of
Madame de Penebrok (<i>sic</i>) had no such title; but that it
was true, that since the King her father acknowledged her
to be his, she might call her ‘sister,’ as she called the Duke
of Richmond ‘brother’. On her removing, the Duke asked
her what word he should carry to the King; to which she
replied: ‘Nothing else except that his daughter, the Princess,
begged his blessing;’ and when he said that he would not
carry such a message, she told him curtly, he might leave
it; and after protesting several times, that what she did at
the King’s command, should not be to her prejudice, she
retired to weep in her chamber, as she does continually.
Though the said Duke treated her very roughly, the King
reproached him for not having accomplished his charge;
that he went about it too softly; and he was resolved to take
steps to abate the stubbornness and pride of the Princess.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the same measure was to be meted out to
mother and daughter, and the Duke of Suffolk, albeit “he
went about it too softly,” was in each case Henry’s faithful
agent.</p>

<p>Katharine was allowed to remain undisturbed at Buckden,
till Mary was removed from Beaulieu, when it was resolved
to send her to Somersham, in the Isle of Ely, a place surrounded
with deep water and marshes, the most unhealthy
and pestilential spot in England. Katharine, knowing what
awaited her there, refused to stir, and for six days, Henry’s
commissioners remained with her, using persuasion and threats
in vain. She shut herself up in her room, and told them
through a hole in the wall, that if they would take her away
they must break open the doors, and carry her off by force.
This they dared not do, for fear of the people; and the Duke
of Suffolk was obliged to depart with his mission entirely
unfulfilled. To do him justice, it must be remarked that he
was extremely loth to undertake it.</p>

<p>“The Duke of Suffolk,” wrote Chapuys,<a name="FNanchor_114_114"
id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114"
class="fnanchor">[114]</a> “as I am informed
by his wife’s mother, confessed on the Sacrament, and
wished some mischief might happen to him, to excuse himself
from this journey. The King, at the solicitation of the Lady,
whom he dares not contradict, has determined to place the
Queen in the said house, either to get rid of her, or to make
sure of her, as the house is strong; and besides, it is seven
miles from another house, situated in a lake, which one cannot
approach within six miles, except on one side; and the
King and the Lady have agreed to seek all possible occasions
to shut up the Queen within the said island, and failing all
other pretexts to accuse her of being insane.”</p>

<p>Nothing is more apparent, in all that Chapuys writes at
this time, than Henry’s weakness in whatever concerned Anne.
His passion for her was already on the wane, but he dared not
disregard her least wish, and her empire over him, although
exercised by different means, was as great as it had ever
been. One day he set out for Hatfield, to pay a visit to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
little Elizabeth, and at the same time, to try all that persuasion
and threats from his own lips could do, to reduce
Mary to submission, and induce her to give up her title.
Anne, considering his “easiness or lightness (if any one
dared to call it so), and that the beauty, virtue and prudence
of the Princess might assuage his wrath and cause him
to treat her better,” sent Cromwell and other messengers after
him to prevent his seeing or speaking with his daughter
Mary. Accordingly, Henry, before arriving at the house,
sent on orders that she was not to come to him, and while he
was there, he delegated to Cromwell, to the treasurer, and to
the captain of the guard, the office of remonstrating with her.
But to all their arguments she replied that she had already
given a decided answer, that it was labour wasted to press
her further, and that they were deceived if they thought that
rudeness, bad treatment, or even the fear of death would
shake her determination. While her father was with Elizabeth,
she sent to ask leave to come and kiss his hand; but
this request he dared not grant. Just, however, as he was
about to mount his horse, he looked up (Chapuys is uncertain
whether by chance or whether his attention was directed by
some one present) to the terrace on the top of the house, and
saw Mary on her knees, with her hands clasped. He bowed
to her, and put his hand to his hat, whereupon all present,
who had before this not dared to look at her, “saluted her
reverently with signs of goodwill and compassion”.<a name="FNanchor_115_115"
id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>The ambassador continues:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>
<p>“The day before yesterday, the Lady having heard of the
prudent replies of the Princess, complained to the King that
he did not keep her close enough, and that she was badly
advised, as her answers could not have been made without
the suggestion of others, and that he had promised that none
should speak to her without his knowing it. Twenty days
ago, the King said to the Marquis [of Saluce, who had come
with a proposal of marriage] that the trust the Princess had
in your Majesty made her obstinate, but he would bring her
to the point, as he feared neither the Emperor nor any other,
if the Marquis and other vassals were loyal, as he thought
they would be; they must not trip or vary, for fear of losing
their heads, and he would keep such good watch, that no
letters could be received from beyond sea, without his knowing
it. Besides his trust in his subjects, he has great hope in the
Queen’s death. He lately told the French ambassador, that
she could not live long, as she was dropsical, an illness she
was never subject to before. It is to be feared, something has
been done to bring it on. I told Gregory Casale of this
saying of the King’s, and he replied that he thought of renouncing
the King’s service before leaving here, and of setting
up the white banner.... The Queen has not been out of her
room since the Duke of Suffolk was with her, except to hear
Mass in a gallery. She will not eat nor drink what the new
servants provide. The little she eats, in her anguish, is prepared
by her chamberwomen, and her room is used as her
kitchen. She is very badly lodged; she desires me to write
to you about it.”</p>

<p>On the 11th February he continues:<a name="FNanchor_116_116"
id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116"
class="fnanchor">[116]</a>—</p>

<p>“The French ambassador told me that the King on
returning from a visit to his new daughter, said that he had
not spoken to the Princess, on account of her obstinacy, which
came from her Spanish blood; and when the ambassador
remarked that she had been very well brought up, the tears
came into his eyes, and he could not refrain from praising
her. Anne is aware of the King’s affection for the Princess,
and does not cease to plot against her. A gentleman told me
yesterday, that the Earl of Northumberland told him, that he
knew for certain she had determined to poison the Princess.
The Earl may know something of it from his familiarity and
credit with Anne. The Princess has been warned to be on
her guard, but if God do not help her, it will be difficult for
her to protect herself for long. I do not know any other
remedy, except to persuade the Scotch ambassador to make
the King and his Council believe that his master will not make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
peace unless the right of succession, on the death of the
Princess is reserved to him. This he has promised to do, and
said he would come and see me yesterday about it, without
caring for the suspicions these people might have. I thought
also that the Princess, after making solemn protestations of
compulsion and danger, might offer to the King to be content
not to be called Princess, if she was allowed to reside with the
Queen; but Anne might be encouraged to execute her wicked
will from fear of a reconciliation between the Princess and
her father, and would be able to do it with less suspicion,
under colour of friendship, than now that her hatred and
enmity is open. Perhaps also, those who now favour the
Princess would become cool towards her, not knowing the
cause of her actions, nor the protestations. A gentleman
told me that Anne had sent to her father’s sister (Alice,
widow of Sir Thomas Clere of Ormesby, in Norfolk), who has
charge of the Princess, telling her not to allow her to use that
title, and if she did otherwise, she must box her ears as a
cursed bastard—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quelle
luy donnast des buffes comme a une
mauldicte bastarde telle quelle estoit</span></i>. The Princess has
been used to breakfast in her chamber, and then come to
table in public, but neither eat nor drink, but Anne has now
ordered that she shall not be served in her chamber. She
is going to see her daughter, the first Thursday in Lent, and
will stay two days. I pray this may not be to the injury
of the Princess. The French ambassador said he was astonished
that good guard was not kept about the Princess, to
keep her from being carried away, as it would totally ruin the
King if she were to cross the sea. This agrees with what I
have already written, that the King did not care to marry her
on the other side of the sea.”</p>

<p>Mary’s condition became daily worse. Her position in
Elizabeth’s household was rather that of an attendant, than
of a lady-in-waiting, and to the humiliations showered upon
the unhappy girl was now added the want of the barest necessaries
of life. The “pearl of the kingdom” was less well
provided for than the meanest of her father’s subjects. Failing
all other methods, she was to be starved into a surrender, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
if she would not dine at the common table, was to have nothing
to eat at all. Anne’s vindictiveness increased, when some
peasants, assembling under Mary’s balcony, cheered the poor
prisoner, calling her their rightful Princess. Chapuys’ despatch
of the 21st February chronicles what is perhaps the high-water
mark of her disgrace.</p>

<p>“The Princess,” he writes,<a name="FNanchor_117_117"
id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
“finding herself nearly destitute
of clothes and other necessaries, has been compelled to send a
gentleman to the King. She ordered him to take money or
the clothes, but not to accept any writing in which she was
not entitled Princess. He was also charged to ask leave for
her to attend Mass, at the church which adjoins the house,
but this was not allowed. As the country people seeing her
walk along a gallery saluted her as their princess, she is now
kept much closer, and nothing done without the leave of the
sister of Anne Boleyn’s father, who has charge of her. The
Duke of Norfolk, and Anne’s brother lately reprimanded her for
behaving to the Princess with too much respect and kindness,
saying that she ought only to be treated as a bastard. She
replied, that even if the Princess were only the bastard of a
poor gentleman, she deserved honour and good treatment
for her goodness and virtues. The Princess is well in health,
and bears her troubles with patience, trusting in God and
your Majesty, and showed no better cheer in her prosperity
than now. God grant that this may not irritate this accursed
Lady to carry out her detestable imaginations.”</p>

<p>Charles was not unmindful of the perils which surrounded
his aunt and cousin, but he was greatly embarrassed for means
to help them. Henry was deaf to persuasive arguments; the
argument of force still remained to be applied, but this would
involve the Emperor in a series of complications, out of which
he did not see his way. If he made war on Henry, he would
have to reckon with Henry’s ally and his own enemy, the
King of France, who was by no means so scrupulous a
Catholic, that he would hesitate to take up a hostile attitude
towards the Pope, in a matter which was considered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
by the rest of Christendom as the Pope’s peculiar province.
Henry had effected a formal rupture with Rome, and still
Francis was as friendly to him as before. Moreover, the
French court, although it had professed to be shocked by
Anne’s effrontery, was known to favour the new Queen
secretly; and dominating all these other difficulties was the
Emperor’s accumulated debt to Henry, which his nephew was
less than ever in a position to pay. A chess-board policy
was therefore all that was possible in the actual state of affairs.
Not any amount of sacrifices on the part of Charles would
avail to help his aunt’s cause, and the letter which he wrote
at this juncture to his ambassador in France, is alike a voucher
for the accuracy of Chapuys’ narrative of affairs in England,
and a confession of weakness by the Emperor.</p>

<p>“You have done well,” he writes, “to report what you
have heard touching practices against the Princess of England,
and what the King of France has said to you touching the
King of England’s rupture with the Pope and the Holy See,
and his making alliance with the Lutherans, and pretending
that the Queen our aunt is ill. We have heard the same from
our ambassador in England, much to our grief. And you
are to tell Francis that the more Henry disowns obedience to
the Holy See, the more he ought to support it. As to the
report spread by the King of England, that the Queen our
aunt is ill, you are to take an opportunity of telling him that
she is in very good health of body, notwithstanding her ill-treatment,
and that the spreading of such a report is very
suspicious—all the more, as they have put her in a very
unhealthy habitation, and taken away her physician, and
almost all her servants, so that the <i>essai</i> of viands is no longer
made. You have done right to inform Cifuentes<a name="FNanchor_118_118"
id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of this,
although our ambassador in England has also done so.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119"
id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>Whether Chapuys was right in thinking that Anne would
make a pretence of friendship with Mary, in order to destroy
her more completely, or whether, having tried her utmost to
break the Princess’s spirit, she now thought to win her enemy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
by gentler means, it is certain that in March 1534 she suddenly
changed her tactics.</p>

<p>She went to Hatfield, ostensibly to see Elizabeth, but as
soon as she arrived, she sent a message to Mary inviting her
to come and salute her as the queen she was. If Mary
would do so, Anne promised that she would intercede with her
father on her behalf.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation, Mary replied that she
knew no queen in England but her mother; but she would
be much obliged if the Lady Anne Boleyn would be a
means to the King in her favour. Anne tried again, sent
a fresh message, but was again repulsed, whereupon she
threatened “to break the haughtiness of this unbridled
Spanish blood”.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120"
class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>But if Anne’s hatred increased from this moment, her power
to influence Henry was visibly on the decline. Her very
threats are henceforth indicative of her weakened hold on his
inconstant mind. In the course of the year 1534, there was
a question of his departure for France, and Anne was more
than once heard to say, that when he had crossed the sea,
and she remained in England as regent, she would use her
authority to put Mary to death, either by starving her or
otherwise. When her brother, Lord Rochford represented
to her that this would anger the King, she replied that she
did not care, even if she were burned alive for it afterwards.
“The Princess,” adds Chapuys, “quite expects this, and
thinking that she could not better gain Paradise than by such
a death, shows no concern, trusting only in God, whom she
has always served well, and does still better now. Having
spoken to the Queen, by her advice, I will make remonstrances;
but I know not if they will do any good.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121"
id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>In a formal letter of protest, dated 7th June 1534, against
the treatment she had received, in being declared illegitimate,
and deprived of her title of Princess of Wales, Mary declared
that she would not enter a convent, or take any such step at
the will of her father, without the free consent of her mother.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
The strange mixture of firmness, self-reliance and sweetness
in her behaviour at this time, was a source of wonder and
admiration to all not utterly devoid of human pity, and even
strangers were impressed with such conduct in a girl of
eighteen, whose whole life appeared to be one perpetual
lesson on the “uses of adversity”.</p>

<p>Chapuys told the French Admiral on his visit to England
“that those who had shown him the Tower, and several other
things, had not shown him the principal gem of all the
kingdom, to wit the Princess. He replied that he was as
much vexed as possible, that he had no opportunity of seeing
her, although he had several times spoken about her, and
used means to that effect. I asked if he had been refused
a sight of her, and he confessed that he had not expressly
requested it, but that the King never would come to the point.
He added that he had never heard a lady so praised as the
Princess, even by those who were giving her trouble; and
certainly he was her devoted servant, both on account of her
great virtue, and because she was so nearly related to the
Queen his mistress,<a name="FNanchor_122_122"
id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122"
class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and that he hoped for certain, soon to do
her good service.”<a name="FNanchor_123_123"
id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123"
class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>Chapuys had now begun to speak very openly to the
King and Cromwell, insisting on the discussion of matters
over which they would rather have drawn a veil. Of some
of these Cromwell declared that “neither sugar nor sauce
would make them go down”.</p>

<p>It was evident to the envoy, that all their hope lay in the
Queen’s death, and he was at no pains to conceal the fact
that he had fathomed their designs. He had petitioned
the King for leave to attend Parliament when Katharine’s
cause was tried, and to state her case plainly. But Henry
refused, on the plea that it was not customary for foreigners
to be present at parliamentary debates. Chapuys protested
that there had never been such a case before, and that no
Parliament could stigmatise the birth of the Princess, for the
cognizance of such cases belonged to ecclesiastical judges,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
and that even if his marriage with the Queen were null, Mary
was still his legitimate daughter, owing to the lawful ignorance
of her parents. The Archbishop of Canterbury, he declared,
had not dared to cast a slur on her birth, and the King himself
had considered her as the heir to the throne, until the birth of his
new daughter. Henry seemed more moved by this, than by
anything else that Chapuys had said; but he still maintained
that there was no need for Katharine, or any one else to be
summoned to Parliament, as he himself being a party could
not be there, and that according to the laws of the kingdom,
Mary was unable to succeed, and there was no other Princess
except his daughter Elizabeth, who was the heir, until he had
a son, which he thought would happen soon, adding that he
did not care for all the canons which might be alleged, as he
preferred his own laws, according to which he would have
legitimacy judged by lay judges, who could also take cognizance
of matrimonial causes. “As,” remarked Chapuys,
“I thought this was strange, he said he would send me books.
I asked him to do so, and also to show me the law which,
he says, makes against the Princess; but he will do neither
the one nor the other, for he will not find what he wants.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124"
id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Soon after Anne’s visit to Hatfield, Elizabeth was removed
to the More, and Mary, thinking that she would prejudice
her own and her mother’s cause by consenting to go in
her suite, declared that she had no objection to go to the
same place either before or after Elizabeth, but that she would
not pay court to her on the road, unless she was led by force.
She was accordingly put into a litter, when she took the
opportunity of making a public protest. Chapuys thought
this ill-advised, since it might only serve to irritate the King,
and draw upon herself worse treatment than before, “at the
desire of his mistress, who is constantly plotting the worst she
can against the Princess”.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord"><a name="i_074.jpg" id="i_074.jpg"></a>

        alt="" />
  <div class="caption">SIR THOMAS MORE, LORD CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND.<br />
    From the original portrait by Holbein.</div>
</div>

<p>The shrewdness of the ambassador was not at fault, and
Mary was treated more rigorously than ever. When Henry
paid a visit of two days to the More, she was commanded not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
to leave her room, and was told that her father did not care
in the least, whether she renounced her title or not, since by
statute she was now declared illegitimate, and incapable of
succeeding. It was also reported to her, that Henry had said
he would make her lose her head, for violating the laws of his
realm. She was constantly watched, so that it was extremely
difficult for her to communicate this new danger to Chapuys.
Her ingenuity provided her, however, with a means which
proved successful. Her old schoolmaster and friend, Master
Featherstone, happened to be in the house, and Mary
asked to speak with him privately. This being refused,
she contrived to tell him what she wished he should know,
without exciting the suspicion of the bystanders. She began
to say to him that she had been now so long without speaking
Latin, that she could not say two words properly, and he desiring
to judge for himself, asked her to say something in that
language. Then she told him what the King had said that
day, no one present understanding Latin. He was astounded,
and could only answer, that that was not good Latin, and immediately
sent to inform Chapuys,<a name="FNanchor_125_125"
id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
who related the occurrence
to the Emperor. In the same despatch the envoy says:—</p>

<p>“It is feared the King will put to death the Bishop of
Rochester, and Mr. More, late Chancellor, who, as I lately
wrote, are confined in the Tower with others, for refusal to
swear. The Scotch ambassadors laugh at this King, with
good reason, for imagining to strengthen his cause and his
laws by this oath violently extorted, for it rather tends to
show that they are worth nothing, since they require such
help to maintain them.”</p>

<p>On the 14th May he wrote:—</p>

<p>“Some days ago the King asked his mistress’s aunt, who
has charge of the Princess, if the latter had abated her obstinacy,
and on being answered ‘No,’ he said there must be some one
about her who encouraged her, and conveyed news from the
Queen, her mother. The said gouvernante, on consideration,
could suspect no one, except the maid of whom I lately wrote,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
who had been compelled to swear, and on this suspicion, she
drove her out, and she has been for some days without any one
to go to, or means to support herself. The Princess has been
much grieved at this, for she was the only one in whom she had
confidence, and by her means, she had letters from me and others.
The Queen also is very sorry, but still more because the King
has taken from the Princess her confessor, a very good man,
and given her another who is a Lutheran, and a tool of his
own. During the last few days, the King perceiving that
neither by force nor menaces could he get his way with the
said Princess, or for some other reasons, has shown her more
honour than usual, and used more gracious words, begging
that she would lay aside her obstinacy, and he would promise
her before Michaelmas to make such a bargain with her, that
she should enjoy a royal title and dignity, to which, among
1000 other wise answers, she replied that God had not so
blinded her as to confess for any kingdom on earth that the
King, her father, and the Queen, her mother, had so long lived
in adultery, nor would she contravene the ordinance of the
Church, and make herself a bastard. She believes firmly that
this dissimulation the King uses is only the more easily to
attain his end, and cover poison. But she says she cares little,
having full confidence in God, that she will go straight to
Paradise, and be quit of the tribulations of this world; and
her only grief is about the troubles of the Queen, her
mother.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>Seeing that she was liable to make mistakes, if guided by
her own inexperience, Mary was anxious in future to do
nothing without Chapuys’ advice, as the following letter from
the ambassador shows:—</p>

<p>“The Princess, understanding of late that the King intended
she should remove, and accompany the Bastard, sent to me
three times in less than twenty-four hours to know what to
do. I wrote back to her each time, resolving her scruples,
that even if she did obey the King without opposition or protestation,
all that the King desired in this respect could do no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
prejudice to the protestations already made. Nevertheless, I
thought that to prevent her father and his lady imagining she
was worn out, and conquered by ill-treatment, she should
speak boldly, and with her accustomed modesty, but not go
to the extremity of allowing herself to be taken by force, as on
the former occasion. I wrote to her at full length what she
ought to say; not that it was necessary, considering her good
sense, but because she desired me. She played her part so
well, that the Comptroller promised her she should not go
after the other. Nevertheless, on her coming to the first
door of the lodging, there was the litter of the Bastard, and
the Princess was compelled to go out after her, the Comptroller
allowing her, as soon as she was mounted, to go before or
after, as she pleased; on which account, she suddenly pushed
forward, and arrived at Greenwich about an hour before the
Bastard. When she came to enter the barge, she took care
to secure the most honourable place. I had intimated to her
that I would go to Greenwich to see her pass; and she sent to
beg me to do so, as earnestly as she could. I was there accordingly
in disguise, and it was a great pleasure to see such excellent
beauty, accompanied by heroic bearing, which all the
more increased the pity to see her so treated.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127"
id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>A little later Chapuys, continuing his narrative, says:—</p>

<p>“Although Cromwell assured me of the goodwill the King
bore the Princess, I should scarcely have believed it, but for
some other things, which make it probable. For the King has
commanded that she shall be well treated; and on Wednesday,
before leaving the More, she was visited by nearly all the gentlemen
and ladies of the court, to the Lady’s great annoyance.
On Thursday, the day before yesterday, being at Richmond
with the little lass, the Lady came to see her said daughter,
accompanied by the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk and others,
including some of the ladies, which was a novelty; and she
refused to leave her chamber till the Lady was gone, that she
might not see her. The first time that the said Princess
accompanied the said little one, she was placed in a litter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
covered with leather; but on leaving the More, she had one
of velvet like the other, in which she came to Richmond; and
being there, both to avoid following the litter of the other,
and because she was pleased to see me in passing, she let
the little one go by land, and came herself by water. In
the evening, she arranged with the bargemen to row her along
the bank where she pleased, and immediately gave notice to
me, that I would not fail to be at a certain house, which I keep
in the fields by the river, between Greenwich and this town, to
inhabit in time of plague, for she wished to see me, and requite
my going to see her at Greenwich, when she passed. She
accordingly persuaded the steersman, instead of going by one
side of the river, to take the other, and from the time she
came near enough to see me, she caused the barge to be
uncovered, and went on deck in the most conspicuous place,
and passed quite near where I was, never moving from the
place she had taken up to look at me, until she had lost sight
of me. She is, thank God, in very good health and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en bon
point</span></i>, and appears to be happy and very cheerful. I notified
to her before she left the More, that as the King’s severity was
abating, she must take care not to give him any cause of
offence, and as the protestation I had counselled her to make
preserved her from all danger, she ought to make no difficulty
about following the Bastard, but should declare that she was
very glad in this to satisfy the King her father, and from that
proceeded the visit paid to her at Richmond,<a name="FNanchor_128_128"
id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128"
class="fnanchor">[128]</a> of which I have
written above, and the licence to come by water without
accompanying the other.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129"
id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>Early in 1535, Mary fell ill, and Henry in a moment of
relenting, not only allowed her mother’s physician and apothecary
to attend her, but sent his own physician, Dr. Buttes.
The only stipulations made were that they must see her in
the presence of witnesses, speak in no language but English,
and pay their respects on their arrival to Elizabeth, before
being conducted to Mary. The latter part of the order could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
not, however, be carried out, as it arrived too late.<a name="FNanchor_130_130"
id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Katharine
eagerly seized the opportunity of Henry’s sudden kindness
to entreat that her daughter might be sent to her, a petition
that was answered with the singular concession, that the King
would send her to a house near her mother, provided that
the two did not meet. Her letter to Cromwell, in acknowledging
his services in the negotiation, such as they were, is
as pathetic as it is dignified.</p>

<p>“My good friend,” wrote Katharine, “you have laid me
under great obligation by the trouble you have taken in
speaking to the King, my lord, about the coming of my
daughter to me. I hope God will reward you, as you know
it is out of my power to give you anything but my goodwill.
As to the answer given you, that the King is content to take
her to some house near me, provided I do not see her, I beg
you will give him my hearty thanks for the good he does to
his daughter and mine, and for the peace of mind he has
given me. You may assure him, that if she were but a mile
from me I would not see her, because the time does not
permit me to go visiting, and if I wished it, I have not the
means. But you may tell his Majesty, it was my wish that he
should send her where I am, as the comfort and cheerfulness
she would have with me would be half her cure. I have found
this by experience, being ill of the same sickness, and as my
request was so reasonable, and touched so greatly the honour
and conscience of the King, I did not think it would be denied
me. Do not forbear, I beseech you, and do what you can
that it may be so. I have heard that he had some suspicion
of her security—a thing so unreasonable that I cannot believe
it entered into his heart, nor do I think he has so little
confidence in me. If such a thing be assumed, I beg you to
tell his Majesty, it is my fixed determination to die in this
kingdom; and I offer my person as security that if such a
thing be attempted, he may do justice upon me as the most
traitorous woman that ever was born.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131"
id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Katharine made another attempt to get possession of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
daughter; and the letter which she wrote to Chapuys with
that object is very touching in its tender, maternal anxiety:—</p>

<p>“My physician has informed me partly of my daughter’s
illness, giving me hope of her improved health; but as I know
her infirmity lasts so long, and I see he is slow to visit her
(although for some days he could not, as I was so ill myself),
I have great suspicion as to the cause. So because it appears
to me that what I ask is just, and for the service of God, I
beg you will speak to his Highness, and desire him, on my
behalf, to do such a charity as to send his daughter and mine
where I am; because treating her with my own hands, and by
the advice both of other physicians and of my own, if God
pleases to take her from this world, my heart will rest satisfied;
otherwise, in great pain. You shall also say to his
Highness that there is no need of any other person but myself
to nurse her; that I will put her in my own bed where I
sleep, and will watch her when needful. I have recourse to
you, knowing that there is no one in this kingdom who dare
say to the King my lord, that which I desire you to say; and
I pray God reward you for the diligence that you will make.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132"
id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Immediately after receiving this letter, Chapuys asked
Cromwell to arrange an interview with the King, which was
assigned for the next morning. When he had read the letter
aloud to Henry, the ambassador supported it by all the arguments
he could think of, and instead of replying, as usual,
that he knew better than any one else how to provide for his
daughter, Henry answered gently that he wished to do his
utmost for her health, but that he must not forget what was due
to his own honour, which would be injured if she were taken
out of the kingdom, or if she herself escaped, as she might
easily do, by night, if she were with her mother, for he had
begun to suspect the Emperor of designs for getting her away.</p>

<p>Chapuys craftily allayed this suspicion, but Henry went
on to say that there was no great occasion to confide Mary
again to her mother’s hands, for it was Katharine who had
put it into her head to show such obstinacy and disobedience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
as all the world knew; and although sons and daughters were
bound to show some obedience towards their mothers, their
chief duty was to their fathers, and since the Princess could
not have much help from the Queen, and it was clear the
whole matter proceeded from her, Mary must submit to his
pleasure. Chapuys then asked that she might, at least, have
her old governess, Lady Salisbury, whom she regarded as her
second mother. But Henry declared that she was a fool, of
no experience, and that if his daughter had been under her
care, she would have died, for Lady Salisbury would not have
known what to do, whereas her present governess was an
expert lady. All the physicians were apparently agreed, that
Mary’s illness was caused by distress and sorrow, and that if
the Princess were placed where she might enjoy a modicum of
brightness and pleasure, and might be allowed to take exercise,
her cure would be effected.</p>

<p>Dr. Buttes urged the responsibility he would incur in attending
her, unless she were within reach of her mother’s
medical adviser and apothecary, for in the event of her death
he might be accused of foul play. Chapuys expressed a
hope that some of Mary’s old and loyal servants would be
sent to her, to keep her cheerful; but he recommended that her
governess should not be changed, for he feared lest some one
should give her a slow poison; whereas Anne’s aunt had long
been warned that she would be suspected, if anything untoward
happened to her charge. There was, she was told, a
common belief in London, that she had already attempted to
poison the Princess, so that the poor creature was terribly
alarmed, and could do nothing but weep and lament whenever
Mary was ill. Cromwell agreed that Chapuys’ demands
were just, “but matters,” he said, “were rather hard of digestion,
and he couldn’t get his master to chew them”.</p>

<p>In spite of all efforts, nothing was done to better Mary’s
condition. But her illness abated, and on the 23rd March
the ambassador told Cardinal Granvelle, that the Princess was
well again, and “better than some would have her. She may
be called,” he continued, “the paragon of beauty, goodness
and virtue.” But she was constitutionally delicate, and suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
all her life, from a malady aggravated by the grief and sorrow
which overwhelmed her in her youth. The violent attack
which prostrated her in the beginning of 1535 followed immediately
upon the information that had been conveyed to her
at Christmas, of the statute lately framed against those who
refused to acknowledge the King’s second marriage, and upon
the command made directly to her, to renounce her title and
her mother’s, and to take the oath of supremacy. A refusal,
she was told, rendered her liable to instant imprisonment,
and danger of death.</p>

<p>In clinging to mere formulas, Mary was influenced by no
pride or obstinacy, for in yielding she would have implicitly
repudiated her mother’s marriage, and have admitted a slur
on her own birth. While maintaining her title she vindicated
both.</p>

<p>Chapuys was now more thoroughly alarmed for Mary’s
safety than ever, and the Emperor began to make plans for
spiriting his cousin over to Flanders. “As to the possibility
of withdrawing the Princess from hence,” the envoy
declared, “the thing is so hazardous at present, that I doubt if
she would listen to it. For besides that one must put oneself
at the mercy of the wind, she is so strictly guarded that I can
scarcely communicate to her anything; for apart from her
indisposition, I have only suggested to her whether she would
not like to be beyond the sea, and she replied that she
desired nothing else.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133"
id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
Shortly afterwards he continues:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
“Whatever pretence the King makes about the Princess’s
illness, he has been very cold; in fact, she was taken ill on
Friday, and he did not send his physician thither till Thursday
after, and I do not know if he would have gone even then
if I had not importuned Cromwell. On Friday afterwards
she was let blood, and on Monday following, when I spoke
to the King, he did not know she had been let blood, or anything
about her condition. Since the first news, I have sent
to her four or five times, by my servants, who make a poor
report of her treatment, and of her company. She sent to
me yesterday, two persons, to beg that I would continue to
send some of my servants to her, for that caused her to be
better respected. Your Majesty may consider what solace
and pastime she can have with those about her, hearing
them desire her death, by which, they say, the world would
be at peace, and they, discharged of the pain and trouble
they have had about her. As to getting her away from
hence, it could be accomplished by having a pinnace on the
river (Mary was then at Greenwich) and two armed ships at
the mouth of the river; at least I could find means to get
her out of the house almost at any hour of the night.”</p>

<p>On the 5th April he says:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<p>“The Princess, in order not to be altogether shut up,
has remained ten or twelve days at Greenwich, since the
little one was removed thence. On the 1st inst., she left for
the house of which I wrote formerly. She wished to go on
horseback, but as three of my servants were mounted to
accompany her, those who had charge of her made her enter
the litter, and her <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernante</span></i>
along with her, and there she
remained, till my servants took leave of her, six miles from
here. The litter was covered with velvet, and was by far the
most honourable she had had since her misfortunes. This
favour has been allowed to her this year, besides that the
King, her father, has sent her since Christmas, on two
occasions, sixty or eighty ducats. Since the little Bastard
removed from Greenwich, considering that one of the galleons
of La Renterie was on the other side of the river, and that
there were some other Spanish ships here, by means of which
the Princess might be saved, I sent to her to know if she
would agree to it. She gave ready ear to the suggestion,
saying she desired nothing else, and has since sent two or
three times for my man, to solicit the matter; but her sudden
departure broke off the enterprise, to which also, I did not
dare commit myself, not having commandment from your
Majesty, considering the practices put in train, since it pleased
you to charge me to write what means there might be of
withdrawing her. Nevertheless, the said Princess continues
in her purpose to go away, and has sent to desire me by my
servant, who has just come from seeing her, that, for the love
of God, I will contrive to remove her from the danger, which
is otherwise inevitable, adding that where she is now, there
is no means of saving her by night, and that as soon as it
was fine weather, she would go out walking, to see what
arrangement could be made to come upon her by surprise, in
the daytime, and so that it should appear as little as possible
that it was by her consent; for the sake of her own honour,
and the less to irritate the King, her father. The house where
she lies is twelve miles from this river, and if once she could
be found alone, it would be easier to save her than it is at
Greenwich, for we could put her on board beyond Gravesend,
past the danger of this river. The matter is hazardous, and
your Majesty will take it into due consideration.”</p>

<p>The same day, he wrote to Granvelle:—</p>

<p>“If I were to tell you the messages she sent me at her
leaving Greenwich, and again this morning, you could not
refrain from tears, begging me to have pity on her, and
advise her as I thought best, and she would obey....</p>

<p>“If the Princess going out to sport were once seized, and
put on horseback, and there were ready a great ship or
two and a row boat, the thing would be done. Except her
guards, and some of the other side, the people would help
her, and those sent in pursuit would shut their eyes, and
bless those who had carried her off.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134"
id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>About this time, Mary and Elizabeth had removed to
Eltham, and Anne Boleyn again paid her daughter a visit.
In <i>The Life of Jane Dormer, Duchess of Feria</i>, it is recorded
of this visit<a name="FNanchor_135_135"
id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135"
class="fnanchor">[135]</a> that the Princess Mary, and the Lady Anne
Boleyn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
“heard Mass together in one room. At the end of
Mass, the Lady Mary made a low curtsy, and went to her
lodging; so did the Lady Anne, then called queen. When
she came to her quarter, one of her maids told her that the
Lady Mary at parting made reverence to her, she answered
that she did not observe it, and said: ‘If we had seen it,
we would have done as much to her,’ and presently sent a
lady of honour to her to excuse it; adding, that the love of
none should be dearer nor more respected than hers, and
she would embrace it with the kindness of a true friend. The
lady that carried the message came when the Lady Mary was
sat down at dinner. When admitted, she said: ‘The queen
salutes your grace with much affection, and craves pardon,
understanding that at your parting from the oratory, you made
a curtsy to her, which, if she had seen, she would have
answered you with the like; and she desires that this may be
an entrance of friendly correspondence which your grace shall
find completely to be embraced on her part’. ‘It is not
possible,’ answered the Lady Mary, ‘that the queen can send
me such a message; nor is it fit she should, nor can it be so
sudden, her majesty being so far from this place. You would
have said the Lady Anne Boleyne, for I can acknowledge no
other queen but my mother, nor esteem them my friends who
are not hers. And for the reverence that I made, it was to
the altar, to her Maker and mine; and so, they are deceived,
and deceive her who tell her otherwise.’ The Lady Anne was
maddened with this answer, replying that one day she would
pull down this high spirit.”</p>

<p>In 1534, Mary’s position was momentarily alleviated by
the influence of a friend at court, a young lady, who had
for the time being taken the King’s roving fancy,<a name="FNanchor_136_136"
id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> and who
sent the Princess word to be of good cheer, and that her
troubles would sooner come to an end than she supposed,
and that when the opportunity occurred, she would show herself
Mary’s true and devoted servant.<a name="FNanchor_137_137"
id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137"
class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Anne was furiously
jealous, and intrigued with her sister-in-law, Lady Rochford,
to have the young woman removed from court. But Henry
discovered the plot, and banished Lady Rochford. The new
favourite’s influence was remarked to increase daily, while
Anne’s diminished, “which,” said Chapuys, “has already abated
a good deal of her insolence”. Cromwell told him that he
had received a charge from the King, that Mary should be
well treated, and that if he found those about her did not do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
their duty, he was to have them punished, and that henceforth
he should not have much difficulty in getting due respect
paid to her, considering Henry’s paternal affection.</p>

<p>However, Anne’s influence although diminished still had
periods of revival, and Mary was made to suffer for every
sign of returning affection which her father manifested towards
her in his moments of reaction.</p>

<p>“As to the King being dissatisfied with the Lady,” said
Chapuys, “it is true he sometimes shows it, but as I have
written before, they are lovers’ quarrels, and not much weight
is to be attached to them, unless the love of the King for the
young lady of whom I wrote to you should grow warm, and
continue some time; of which it is impossible to form a
judgment, considering the changeableness of this King. I
have learned from the Master of the Horse, that when the
Lady began to complain of the said young lady, because she
did not do, either in word or deed, the reverence she expected,
the King went away from her very angry, complaining
of her importunity.”</p>

<p>Describing an interview with Cromwell, Chapuys again
wrote to the Emperor on the 17th April. He continues:—</p>

<p>“He (Cromwell) then replied to me, as he had several times
told me, that it was the Princess, who created the difficulty,
and troubled matters, and that if it pleased God—he did
not dare to say more, but it was quite clear what he wished.
I again spoke about placing her with the Queen, her mother,
but it was of no use; and on my saying that if any illness
overtook her, where she is, evil might befall, before she
received succour, he only answered that it was no question
of illness, and that she was not likely to fall into it. But
he was a bad prophet; and yesterday morning I sent him
two of my servants, booted and spurred, who had just
returned from the Princess in great haste (they had seen
her the day before yesterday) to inform him that she had
had a relapse, and desire that he would notify the King, to
send thither the physician and servants he might think
necessary. This he promised to do; but I fear he will not
do it, or that even if he does, the King will make no account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of it. Ill as the Princess is, she does not cease to think if
there be any means of escaping; and on this subject she had
a long conversation with one of my men, begging me most
urgently to think over the matter, otherwise she considered
herself lost, knowing that they wanted only to kill her. She
has not had leisure to visit the neighbourhood, nor to devise
means how she could get away, night or day. And because
I see the thing is difficult, I keep her in hope of a speedy
remedy by some other means, and endeavour to remove her
suspicion that foul play is intended against her. Cromwell
has always given me to understand that he is much devoted
to the Princess; nevertheless, I have found no evidence of
it except words.... Your Majesty may consider how the
good Princess is placed.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138"
id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Soon afterwards the scheme was abandoned, on account
of the difficulties in the way, and on the 25th April, Chapuys
was able to report that Mary was well again:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>
<p>“The Princess, thank God, has recovered. The King at
my request sent her his physician, lending his own horses,
for want of which, among other reasons the said physician
had excused himself. But when the King told him that it
concerned his honour, especially, seeing that he had promised
to send him whenever the Queen’s physician should be there,
all excuses ceased. He had only made them indeed, not
for want of good will to serve the Princess, but to avoid
the suspicion, in which he was held by the King and his lady,
of too much devotion to her, and also to give occasion for
the Princess being near the Queen, and under the care of her
physician; and the said physician is of the King’s Chamber
with the great people and those of the Council. He understands
many things. He told the Queen’s physician that
there were only two ways to remedy the affairs of the Queen
and the Princess, and of all the realm. The first was, if God
should visit this King with some little illness. Then besides
that of himself he might come to a better mind, he would
also take patiently the remonstrances made to him. The
other way would be to try force, of which he says, the King
and those about him are wonderfully afraid.”</p>

<p>Chapuys then informed the Emperor that “the said physician”
had told him, that if the Emperor would make war,
the right time had come, and that he knew for certain “of
a score of the principal lords of England, and more than
a hundred knights, who were quite ready to employ their
persons, goods, friends and dependants, if they had the
smallest assistance from your Majesty, and that as aforesaid,
the time is most favourable, because the people are every day
more dissatisfied at the taxation, for the levying of which,
they are beginning to depute commissioners to enquire the
value of every one’s goods, and assess them accordingly”.<a name="FNanchor_139_139"
id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
All over the country prevailed a discontent, which not daring
to break out into open rebellion took refuge in seditious
words, and a sullen, almost threatening attitude. People
were constantly arrested for speeches, such as: “It was a pity
that the King was not buried in his swaddling clothes,” and
“It was to be hoped that the Lady Anne would be brought
full low,” and “We shall have no merry world till we have
a new change,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_140_140"
id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140"
class="fnanchor">[140]</a> But in spite of these mutterings,
Henry inspired more terror even than hatred. The butchery
of the Carthusian monks for refusing the oath of supremacy
was followed quickly by the trial and execution of More and
Fisher. Katharine and Mary were in a desperate position.
Cromwell asked Chapuys what evil or danger would arise
from the death of the Princess, even if it did excite the
indignation of the people, and what cause the Emperor would
have to be offended by it.<a name="FNanchor_141_141"
id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Henry was scarcely less to be pitied than
his victims. The nation needed little encouragement to revolt.
His treatment of the Queen and Princess, though not
the whole cause of the disaffection, was a large factor in the
rebellious temper of the people. But if to please them he
showed Mary a little kindness, Anne left him no peace. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
was, it is true, beginning to weary of his fetters, and sometimes
inquired anxiously whether Anne too might not be divorced.
Not, replied his otherwise complaisant advisers, unless he took
back Katharine,<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142"
class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and he was not prepared for such a humiliation
in the eyes of Europe. It would look, forsooth, as if he
submitted after all to the Pope’s decree, and all that he had
done with a high hand would have to be undone. There
was no alternative but to carry out the policy he had determined
upon, but his embarrassment was not lessened
when Francis, through the French Admiral, demanded Mary’s
hand for the Duke of Angoulême. Clearly, Henry had not
succeeded in convincing the world, or even his one friend,
the French King, that Katharine was not his wife, or in
getting him to take Anne’s queenship seriously. The subject
of Mary’s betrothal to the Duke of Orleans had been tacitly
dropped since the divorce. It was no longer a part of
Henry’s plan to marry his elder daughter honourably, or
to allow her to leave the kingdom, and at first he pretended
to regard the Admiral’s commission as a joke. The Duke
of Angoulême, he said, had much better marry the true
Princess, Elizabeth, and so the matter rested; but Francis
would not take Henry’s line with regard to Mary. When
in the autumn of 1535 he sent ambassadors to England for
the purpose of drawing the King into a war with the Emperor,
they were charged to interview her, and find out how she felt
disposed to a marriage with the Dauphin. Mary had, in fact,
not forgotten that she had been affianced to him as a baby,
and would have welcomed any suitable proposal that would
have freed her from the perils of her actual lot. At that
time she was at Eltham with Elizabeth, into whose presence
the French envoys were ushered. To their annoyance they
were not even allowed to see Mary, who had orders to remain
in her room while they were in the house, and to prevent any
possible communication between them and her, the windows of
her apartment were bolted. She had inquired of Chapuys
whether she was to obey or not, and as he had advised submission,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
she amused herself while the ambassadors were with
Elizabeth, by playing on the virginals.<a name="FNanchor_143_143"
id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>During the whole of 1535, Mary was in imminent danger.
Anne constantly urged the King to treat her as he had treated
Cardinal Fisher, saying that it was she who caused all his
troubles, and as for herself she declared of the Princess,
“She is my death and I am hers; so I will take care that
she shall not laugh at me after my death”.<a name="FNanchor_144_144"
id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Anne could
no longer be mistaken as to the decline of her power, and
expressions such as the above are indicative that the general
terror had reached the former favourite. The atmosphere
was heavy with death, and she knew that all depended for
her on the feeble hope that she might shortly give birth
to a son. Henry himself was not free from the uneasiness
which he so well knew how to inspire in others. Tyrant
that he was, he saw danger where no danger lurked, and
was strangely enough misinformed as to the Emperor’s ability
to declare war. In the intervals of disgust which he felt for
Anne, he was ready to stave off the invasion of which he
lived in abject fear, by surrounding Mary with a little more
circumstance; but with the revival of his expectations of a
son, he allowed himself to be goaded into fury by her opposition,
declaring that his worst troubles came from his own
flesh and blood.</p>

<p>On the 6th November, Chapuys wrote:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>
<p>“The Marchioness of Exeter has sent to inform me that
the King has lately said to some of his most confidential
councillors, that he would no longer remain in the trouble,
fear and suspense he had so long endured, on account of the
Queen and Princess, and that they should see, at the coming
Parliament, to get him released therefrom, swearing most
obstinately that he would wait no longer. The Marchioness
declares this is as true as the Gospel, and begs me to inform
your Majesty, and pray you to have pity upon the ladies, and
for the honour of God and the bond of kin to find a remedy.”</p>

<p>And again on the 21st:—</p>

<p>“The personage who informed me of what I wrote to your
Majesty on the 6th, about the Queen and the Princess, <i>viz.</i>,
that the King meant to have them despatched at this next
Parliament, came yesterday into this city in disguise, to confirm
what she had sent to me to say, and conjure me to warn
your Majesty, and beg you most earnestly to see to a remedy.
She added that the King, seeing some of those to whom he
used this language shed tears, said that tears and wry faces
were of no avail, because, even if he lost his crown, he would
not forbear to carry his purpose into effect. These are things
too monstrous to be believed; but considering what has passed,
and goes on daily—the long continuance of these menaces—and,
moreover, that the Concubine, who long ago conspired the
death of the said ladies, and thinks of nothing but getting rid
of them, is the person who governs everything, and whom the
King is unable to contradict, the matter is very dangerous.
The King would fain, as I have already written, make his
Parliament participators, even authors, of such crimes, in
order that, losing all hope of the clemency of your Majesty,
the whole people should be the more determined to defend
themselves when necessary.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145"
id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>To Granvelle he expressed himself thus:—</p>

<p>“The person before mentioned (the Marchioness of Exeter)
has sent to say, that four or five days ago the King, talking
about the Princess, said that he should provide, that soon she
would not want any company, and that she would be an
example to show that no one ought to disobey the laws, and
that he meant to fulfil what had been foretold of him—that is,
that at the beginning of his reign he would be gentle as a
lamb, and at the end worse than a lion. He said also that he
would despatch those at the Tower, and some who were not
there.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146"
class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, one of Henry’s victims was nearing the
end of her trials, and reached it even before the meeting of
Parliament that was to pass sentence of death upon her. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the autumn of 1535 Katharine had what appeared to be a
slight illness, from which she seemed to be recovering, when
at Christmas she suddenly grew worse, and sent to Chapuys,
begging him to come to her without delay. He had no great
difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission, although his
repeated requests to see Mary, and for her to visit her mother,
had been utterly disregarded. He found the Queen suffering
from extreme emaciation, and from sickness. She was unable
to retain any nourishment whatever; but her condition improved
during the few days that Chapuys remained with her,
and she was able to converse with him, and listen to him for
about two hours each day. She also slept better during that
time than she had done before, so that her physician pronounced
her out of danger. Chapuys, “not to abuse the
licence” the King had given him, left Kimbolton, where
Katharine was then residing, on the 5th January, but rode
slowly, in case a messenger should be sent after him with the
news that she was worse, in which event he had promised to
return to her. On his arrival in London, on the 9th, he sent
to ask Cromwell for an audience with the King. In replying
to this request, Cromwell sent word that the Queen had died
little more than forty-eight hours after his leaving her, and
that the news of her death had reached the court on the preceding
Friday. The suddenness of her end, and the circumstances
immediately following it, caused so much suspicion,
that at the time there was hardly any one who did not
firmly believe that she had been poisoned. The account
of what passed was thus communicated to the Emperor
by Chapuys:—</p>

<p>“The Queen died two hours after midday, and eight
hours afterwards, she was opened, by command of those who
had charge of it, on the part of the King, and no one was
allowed to be present, not even her confessor or physician,
but only the candlemaker of the house, and one servant and a
‘compagnon,’ who opened her; and although it was not their
business, yet they have often done such a duty, at least the
principal, who on coming out, told the Bishop of Llandaff,
her confessor, but in great secrecy, as a thing which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
cost his life, that he had found the body and all the internal
organs as sound as possible, except the heart, which was
quite black and hideous, and even after he had washed it three
times, it did not change colour. He divided it through the
middle, and found the interior of the same colour, which also
would not change on being washed, and also some black,
round thing which clung closely to the outside of the heart.
On my man asking the physician if she had died of poison,
he replied that the thing was too evident, by what has been
said to the bishop, her confessor, and if that had not been
disclosed, the thing was sufficiently clear from the report and
circumstance of the illness.</p>

<p>“You could not conceive the joy that the king and those
who favour the concubinage have shown at the death of the good
Queen, especially the Earl of Wiltshire and his son, who said it
was a pity the Princess did not keep company with her. The
King, on the Saturday he heard the news, exclaimed: ‘God
be praised that we are free from all suspicion of war,’ and
that the time had come that he would manage the French
better than he had done hitherto, because they would do now
whatever he wanted, from a fear lest he should ally himself
again with your Majesty, seeing that the cause which disturbed
your friendship was gone. On the following Sunday, the
King was clad all over in yellow, from top to toe, except the
white feather he had in his bonnet; and the little Bastard
was conducted to Mass with trumpets and other great
triumphs. After dinner, the King entered the room in which
the ladies danced, and there did several things, like one transported
with joy. At last he sent for the little Bastard, and
carrying her in his arms, he showed her first to one and then
to another. He has done the like on other days since, and
has run some courses at Greenwich.<a name="FNanchor_147_147"
id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>“This,” added Chapuys,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
“has been the most cruel news
that could come to me, especially as I fear the good Princess
will die of grief, or that the Concubine will hasten what she
has long threatened to do, <i>viz.</i>, to kill her, and it is to be
feared that there is little help for it. I will do my best to
comfort her, in which a letter from your Majesty would help
greatly.”</p>

<p>Luther, writing about this time to Caspar Müller, says:
“The Queen of England is said to be dead, and her daughter
mortally ill; but she has lost her cause all over the world except
with us poor beggars of divines at Wittenberg, who would
gladly have maintained her in her queenly dignity; in which
case she ought to have lived”.<a name="FNanchor_148_148"
id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Katharine was buried with no more ceremony than befitted
a Princess Dowager, some said with much less, in Peterborough
Cathedral, where her remains still lie.</p>

<p>It was intended to have kept her mother’s death a secret
from Mary for some time, but by a mistake the news was
brought to her four days after the event. To Chapuys’
letter of condolence she answered, that following his advice,
“she would show such courage and constancy as he advised
her, but that in any case she would prepare herself
to die”.</p>

<p>“She has written to me,” said the ambassador, “since she
heard the death of the Queen more frequently than she did
before, and this I think to testify the good heart and constancy
to which I continually exhort her, in which certainly she
shows great sense and incomparable virtue and patience, to
bear so becomingly the death of such a mother, to whom she
bore as much love as any daughter did to her mother, who
was her chief refuge in her troubles.”</p>

<p>These events took place at the beginning of 1536, and
Shakespeare, who with his collaborators wrote his play of
“King Henry VIII.” at the end of the same century, had not
only Holinshed’s <i>Chronicle</i>, and other records to guide him,
but a mass of still floating tradition. He had grown to
middle age, surrounded by persons who were in their prime
when Mary’s and her mother’s troubles were in the mouths
of all. He knew of, and described Chapuys’ visit to the dying

<p class="ac noindent">THE GREAT RENUNCIATION.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">1536.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> there was any truth or not in the sinister rumours
concerning the manner in which Katharine had come by her
death, it was natural that Mary should believe them, and
prepare herself for the worst that could befall her. As early
as the 21st January, even before her mother’s obsequies had
taken place in Peterborough Cathedral, Chapuys told his
master that a new campaign had been opened.</p>

<p>“Now the King and the Concubine are planning in several
ways to entangle the Princess in their webs, and compel her
to consent to their damnable statutes and detestable opinions,”
wrote the ambassador, Cromwell having declared that thenceforth
there remained nothing to prevent friendship between
the King and the Emperor, but Mary’s submission. The new
tactics were as puzzling as they were cruel. Scarcely were
Mary’s hopes of better times encouraged by some small
attention, such as a present of money for distribution to the
poor, on her journeys from one residence to another, when a
fresh act of petty tyranny would fill her mind with renewed
apprehensions. The occasional favours were probably intended
as a blind to the Emperor, while the insults which the
unhappy girl was still made to suffer were instances of Anne’s
increasing spite and fury. Thus Cromwell, after showing
her some kindness, summoned her to deliver up a little cross
which her mother had bequeathed to her. Chapuys estimated
that there could not be ten crowns’ worth of gold in the
whole trinket, which contained no jewels, but a fragment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the true Cross to which Mary had great devotion. “Your
Majesty,” said Chapuys, in relating the circumstance, “may
judge what reliance is to be placed upon the words of these
men. I think that God will never give them grace to recognise
their error, lest they should avoid the punishment of
their abominable misdeeds.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150"
id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Pending instructions from Charles, his ambassador advised
the same line of conduct which Mary had hitherto followed,
urging her “to show as good courage and constancy as ever,
with requisite modesty and dignity,” for if they began to find
her at all shaken, they would pursue her to the end, without
ever leaving her in peace. He thought that they would not
insist very much now, on Mary’s openly renouncing her
rights, nor on her abjuring the Pope’s authority directly, but
would be content if she acknowledged Anne as Queen, a
concession that would not cost her much, her mother being
dead. And probably this would have been the case, if Anne
Boleyn had continued to share Henry’s throne. Chapuys
told the Princess to avoid all discussion with the King’s
messengers, but to entreat them to leave her in peace, that
she might pray for her mother’s soul, and for herself, a poor,
simple orphan, without experience or counsel, ignorant of
laws and canons. She was to beseech them to intercede with
her father on her behalf, and beg him to have pity on her, and
if she thought it necessary to say more, she might add with
her customary gentleness, that as it was not the custom in
England to swear fealty to queens, and that as such a thing
had not been done when her mother was held as Queen, she
could not but suspect that her swearing would be, either
directly or indirectly, to her prejudice. Moreover, if Anne
Boleyn really were queen, her swearing or refusing to swear
did not matter, and if she were not, it would be the same.
By the consistorial sentence, her father’s first marriage had
been declared valid, and the second marriage annulled. It
had also been declared, that this lady could not claim the title
of queen, for which reason Mary was to say that she thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
she could not in conscience go against the Pope’s command,
and that by so doing she would prejudice her own right.<a name="FNanchor_151_151"
id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor, meanwhile, communicated the news of his
aunt’s death to the Empress in the following letter:—</p>

<p>“Five or six days ago, the news of the demise of her
most serene Highness, the Queen of England arrived, which
I felt deeply, as you may imagine. May God receive her in
Paradise, which she certainly deserved, on account of her
extreme goodness and virtue, and the excellent life she led.
About her last illness and death the accounts differ. Some
say that it was produced by a painful affection of the stomach,
which lasted upwards of ten or twelve days; others that the
distemper broke out all of a sudden, after taking some draught,
and there is a suspicion, that there was in it, that which in
similar cases is administered. I do not choose to make such
an affirmation, nor do I wish to have it repeated as coming
from me, but nothing can prevent people from judging and
commenting upon the event, according to their own feelings.
Of the Princess, my cousin, I hear only that she is inconsolable
at the loss she has sustained, especially when she thinks
of her father’s past behaviour towards herself, and the little
favour she can expect for the future. I trust, however, that
God will have pity on her, and will not permit the great injustice
which has been shown her to remain without some
reparation. I have put on mourning, and ordered all the
grandees round me, the high officers of this household as well
as the gentlemen of my chamber and table to do the same,
and I myself intend wearing it until I go to Rome. The
exequies have been performed here as is customary in such
cases; there where you are the same ought to be done.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152"
id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>But if Mary’s position was fraught with danger, Anne’s
was still more so. The woman for whose sake Henry had
quarrelled with the Pope, risked a war with the Emperor,
banished his wife and daughter, executed Fisher, More and
the London Carthusians, had now ceased to charm, or even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
to please him. He scarcely spoke to her for weeks together,
and those who understood his methods began to look about
for the new favourite. She was none other than Jane Seymour,
one of Anne’s ladies, whom Chapuys describes as “no
great beauty, over twenty-five years old, of middle stature,
and so fair that one would call her rather pale than otherwise”.
As for her virtue, he will not pledge himself, considering
that the lady has so long frequented the English court;<a name="FNanchor_153_153"
id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> she
has, however, one title to his goodwill, inasmuch as she has
taken up the Princess’s cause warmly. Anne’s enemies were
careful that the fallen favourite should be informed of her new
cause for dread; and the transports of joy with which she
had welcomed the news of Katharine’s death were soon turned
into mourning. She was frequently seen to weep, “fearing,”
said Chapuys, “that they might do with her as with the good
Queen”. Now, at the eleventh hour, it occurred to her that by
conciliating Mary, she might avert her own doom, and she
therefore sent her word that if she would “lay aside her
obstinacy, and obey her father, Queen Anne would be the
best friend in the world to her, like another mother, and
would obtain for her anything she liked to ask”. If Mary
wished to come to court, she would be exempted from holding
the tail of the Queen’s gown, and should walk by her side.
Lady Shelton, Anne’s aunt, besought the Princess with hot
tears to consider the matter, but Mary remained firm.</p>

<p>Anne’s rage and despair almost deprived the now wretched
woman of reason, when she found that all her efforts to win
her were unavailing. She wrote to her aunt, who, as if by
accident, left the letter in Mary’s oratory, where the Princess
could not fail to see and read it. These were its contents:—</p>

<p>“My pleasure is that you do not further move the Lady
Mary towards the King’s grace otherwise than it pleases herself.
What I have done has been more for charity than for
anything the King or I care what road she takes, or whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
she will change her purpose, for if I have a son, as I hope
shortly, I know what will happen to her, and therefore, considering
the Word of God, to do good to one’s enemy, I
wished to warn her beforehand, because I have daily experience,
that the King’s wisdom is such, as not to esteem her
repentance of her rudeness and unnatural obstinacy, when
she has no choice. By the law of God and of the King, she
ought clearly to acknowledge her error and evil conscience,
if her blind affection had not so blinded her eyes that she will
see nothing but what pleases herself. Mrs. Shelton, I beg
you not to think to do me any pleasure by turning her from
any of her wilful courses, because she could not do me good
or evil; and do your duty about her, according to the King’s
commands, as I am assured you do.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154"
id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Mary, of course, saw the letter, took a copy of it for
Chapuys’ instruction, and laid the original where she had
found it.</p>

<p>Of the two women, Anne, at this juncture, inspires the
deeper pity. The overbearing tone of her letter is almost
forgotten in the pathetic cry that escapes her: “If I have a
son, as I hope shortly,” a cry which betrays the last piteous
hope of one who has lost all, if this should fail. Mary, it is
true, daily prepared herself for death, which now seemed
nearer than ever; but beyond the natural love of life belonging
to youth, and to a mind and heart keenly sensitive to all
the interests that make life worth living, she did not desire it
inordinately. For years she had faced death, and had repeatedly
declared that she would rather die a hundred times than
offend God, or do anything against her honour or conscience.</p>

<p>Anne, on the contrary, had sacrificed everything and everybody
to the gratification of her own vanity, ambition and
lightness; and now, abandoned by the King, the scorn of the
court, the laughing-stock of the whole nation, she could but
cling, a shipwrecked waif, to one poor spar, destined, like all
else, to fail her. The day of Katharine’s funeral was a fatal
day to the usurper. She had looked forward with passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
longing to the time when her rival should cease to exist, and
leave her in undisputed possession of her queenship. And
now the time had come, and on that very day, the last vestige
of hope faded from before her eyes. Before night, the news
was circulated in London that she had miscarried, and that
the King had treated her with marked coldness. He had
even declared that he had been led to marry her by witchcraft,
that he had grave doubts as to the validity of their
marriage, and as to whether he might consider himself free
to take another wife.<a name="FNanchor_155_155"
id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Anne sought refuge from Henry’s
brutality in recriminations, the last futile resource of the
fallen. Chapuys wrote on the 17th February:—</p>

<p>“The Concubine has since attempted to throw all the
blame on the Duke of Norfolk whom she hates, pretending
that her miscarriage was entirely owing to the shock she
received when, six days before, the Duke announced to her
the King’s fall from his horse. But the King knows very well
that it was not that, for his accident was announced to her in
a manner not to create undue alarm, and besides, when she
heard of it she seemed quite indifferent to it.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156"
id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Both Mary and Chapuys understood Henry too well to
hope for better times, even now that his aversion from Anne
was complete. He would never content himself with the simple
admission that he was weary of her to loathing, but would
contrive to find some means to persuade the world that he
was justified in his resolve to be rid of her. Although he
would be obliged to admit, at least tacitly, that he had been
mistaken, in a matter in which his pride was inextricably
involved, and had sacrificed everything for a creature who
had proved worthless, it was not likely that he would make
further humiliating confessions, by owning that his treatment
of Katharine and his daughter had been a mistake also, but
rather, lest his enemies should triumph, would be prepared to
send Mary to the block, as he had so often threatened.</p>

<p>Chapuys revived the plan, therefore, for carrying her abroad;
and Mary thought it would be easy to escape, “if she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
something to drug the women with”. She would have to
pass Mistress Shelton’s window, but once out of the house,
she could easily find a way to break or open the garden gate.
So eager was she to breathe the air of freedom, that the envoy
believed, that even were he to advise her to cross the Channel
in a sieve she would do it.<a name="FNanchor_157_157"
id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
He saw, however, that it would
be impossible for him to take an active part in her removal,
as suspicion would naturally be directed at once to him, if
the scheme were discovered. He suggested that it might
be as well for him to be recalled, before the actual attempt
was made, so that the vigilance with which the Princess was
guarded might be somewhat relaxed. In accordance with
his desire, the Baron de Rœulx was sent from Flanders with
a vessel, in which Mary was to take flight, and which remained
at anchor a little below Gravesend.<a name="FNanchor_158_158"
id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Mary was now at Hunsdon, fifteen miles farther from
Gravesend than Greenwich, from whence the first attempt
was to have been made; and as it was thought unsafe to
bring the vessel any farther up the river, she would be obliged
to ride forty miles to reach it. This would necessitate relays
of horses, which could not be managed with such rapidity, as
to prevent the risk of discovery. Moreover, the village of
Hunsdon was crowded, and the royal fugitive would have to
pass through several such places, where pursuit would be
instantaneous if suspicion were aroused. Keen as Mary was
to reach a place of safety, she was, says Chapuys, more bent
on preventing further sin and misery, than on escaping from
the dangers of her position, seeking a remedy, whereby innumerable
souls might be saved from perdition.<a name="FNanchor_159_159"
id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> But escape
was soon found to be impossible, unless the Princess could
be lodged nearer to Gravesend; and Chapuys now began to
talk of conciliation. Henry was evidently determined to get
rid of Anne, and was nothing loth to take another wife. If
he died as things were, Mary was certain to succeed; it was,
therefore, to her interest that he should not contract a true
marriage, by which he might have male issue. To this Mary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
replied that she did not care how her own interests might be
affected, if only her father could be saved from the sinful life
he was leading.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160"
class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>It was perhaps to this attitude that Mary owed Jane
Seymour’s espousal of her cause. The new favourite met
Henry’s advances in an exemplary manner. The King sent
her a purse full of gold pieces, and with it a letter. After
kissing the letter, she returned it to the messenger unopened,
and throwing herself on her knees, begged him to represent
to the King that she was a gentlewoman of good and honourable
parents, without reproach, and that she had no greater
riches in the world than her honour. If he wished to make
her some present in money, she begged that it might be when
God enabled her to make some honourable match. The purse
was returned with the letter, and Henry’s admiration for Jane
advanced by leaps and bounds. He caused her to be told
that he did not intend henceforth to speak with her, except in
the presence of some of her kin. He then made Cromwell
dislodge from a room to which he himself had private access
through certain galleries, and gave it to Jane’s eldest brother
and his wife, in order that the young lady might meet him
there in all propriety, and yet unknown to the world. “She
has been well taught,” said the astute Chapuys, “for the most
part by those intimate with the King, who hate the Concubine,
that she must by no means comply with the King’s wishes
except by way of marriage, in which she is quite firm. She
is also advised to tell the King boldly how his marriage is
detested by the people, and none consider it lawful; and on
the occasion when she shall bring forward the subject, there
ought to be present none but titled persons, who will say the
same, if the King put them upon their oath of fealty.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161"
id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Chapuys was greatly in favour of the projected union
with Jane Seymour, considering it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
“a great thing both for
the security of the Princess, and to remedy the heresies here,
of which the Concubine is the cause and principal nurse,
and also to pluck the King from such an abominable and
<i>more than incestuous marriage</i>.<a name="FNanchor_162_162"
id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
The Princess would be very
happy, even if she were excluded from her inheritance by
male issue.”</p>

<p>Henry’s approaching divorce from Anne was hailed with
general satisfaction, the royal secrets being freely commented
on by the people, but something like consternation was felt
when, on the 2nd May, it became known that she had been
arrested, and was lodged in the Tower, in the same apartment
which she had occupied at her coronation three years before.
It is happily unnecessary to discuss here the various counts
on which the miserable woman was tried and condemned, the
whole painful and revolting story having already been amply
told.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163"
class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Great excitement prevailed throughout the country,
and those who hated Anne most were horror-struck at the
scanty show of justice that accompanied her trial. On the 17th
May, Cranmer declared Elizabeth illegitimate, pronouncing
the marriage of her parents null and void from the beginning.
This was a preliminary step to Anne’s execution, sentence of
death having been passed in the secular courts. If “the Concubine”
had been really proved guilty of the grave charges of
immorality brought against her, and if her marriage had been
condemned on a sound judicial basis, there would have been
few to grieve for her fall; but Englishmen have ever been
advocates of fair play, and there was some murmuring at the
mode of procedure throughout her hurried trial. Cranmer
had shown himself terrified at the possible result to himself,
for his share in her advancement, and was suspiciously pliant
in the matter of the sentence of divorce. The evidence
produced against her in court was neither confirmed nor rebutted,
but some was suppressed, as it was alleged to be unfit
for decent ears.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164"
class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>Henry’s own hypocritical and heartless conduct during the
fortnight that elapsed between Anne’s arrest and execution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
disgusted even his friends. On the day of her committal to
the Tower, the Duke of Richmond went as usual to ask his
father’s blessing, when Henry, with tears in his eyes, said that
both he and his sister Mary ought to thank God for having
escaped from the hands of that woman, who had planned their
death by poison, “from which I conclude,” added Chapuys,
“that the King knew something of her wicked intentions”.<a name="FNanchor_165_165"
id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
Early in the course of events, Chapuys wrote to the Emperor:—</p>

<p>“Already it sounds badly in the ears of the public, that the
King, after such ignominy and discredit as the Concubine has
brought on his head, should manifest more joy and pleasure
now since her arrest and trial, than he has ever done on other
occasions; for he has daily gone out to dine here and there
with ladies, and sometimes has remained with them till after
midnight. I hear that on one occasion, returning by the river
to Greenwich, the royal barge was actually filled with minstrels
and musicians of his chamber, playing on all sorts of instruments
or singing; which state of things was by many a one
compared to the joy and pleasure a man feels in getting rid
of a thin, old and vicious hack, in the hope of getting soon a
fine horse to ride—a very peculiarly agreeable task for this
King.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166"
class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Jane Seymour had been sent to a house
about seven miles from London, where Henry could see her
daily when he was at Hampton Court, and on the 14th May
she was lodged with semi-royal magnificence, at a house on
the Thames, in order to be near him at Greenwich. None of
these movements were lost on the people, or on Chapuys, who
expressed his opinion unreservedly that “the little Bastard
would be excluded from the succession,” and that the King
would “get himself requested by Parliament to marry”.</p>

<p>On the 15th, Henry sent a message to Jane, to the effect
that she would hear of Anne’s condemnation at three
o’clock that afternoon, and shortly after dinner, the words
were verified. On the 19th, the day of her execution, as
soon as the news of her death was brought to him, he entered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
his barge, and went to spend the day with Jane. The following
morning, they were betrothed, not married, as many writers
have stated, the marriage ceremony taking place ten days later.</p>

<p>Anne had persisted to the last, in the declaration of her
innocence; but the often quoted letter, supposed to have been
written by her to Henry from the Tower, and which Burnet
printed<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167"
class="fnanchor">[167]</a> as authentic, because he had found it among Cromwell’s
papers, must now be considered spurious. That it
should ever have been regarded as genuine, is among the
unaccountable beliefs that have obtained concerning this
much misrepresented woman. It proclaims itself a forgery
by the style of its composition and mode of expression,
entirely unlike any of Anne’s recognised and undisputed
letters. The speeches also imputed to her before her execution
must be taken with extreme caution, the opportunity
being favourable to romance writers of every subsequent
period, to invent sentiments which neither would nor could
have been uttered or recorded, so great was the terror in
which Henry was held by ministers, judges, courtiers, and the
people. On the other hand, doubt has been thrown on the
authenticity of words and actions which, viewed with their
context, are, to say the least, highly probable. Thus Mr.
Friedmann, the able biographer of Anne Boleyn, while he
admits that the one thing that preyed on her mind was her
conduct towards the Princess, discredits the story of her having
thrown herself at the feet of Lady Kingston, wife of the
Lieutenant of the Tower, entreating her as a favour in like
manner to throw herself at the feet of the Lady Mary, and in
her name beseech her to forgive the many wrongs she had
brought upon her.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168"
class="fnanchor">[168]</a> But there is evidence in a letter from
Mary to Cromwell, dated 26th May 1536, that Lady Kingston
was then present with her, and it is unlikely that she would
have been sent to announce Anne’s death, unless she had
some special message to deliver. In this letter, as if in
response to Anne’s petition for pardon, Mary in mentioning
her fallen enemy adds, “whom I pray our Lord of His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
great mercy to forgive”.<a name="FNanchor_169_169"
id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Moreover, Chapuys told Cardinal
Granvelle, that on her way to the scaffold, “the Concubine
declared that she did not consider herself condemned by
divine judgment, except for being the cause of the ill-treatment
of the Princess, and for having conspired her
death”.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170"
class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Although Henry took no pains to conceal the satisfaction
he felt at his deliverance from Anne, he chose to pretend
that he was heart-broken at her wickedness, and Cranmer,
whose safety depended on a servile acquiescence in his
master’s every whim, begged him “somewhat to suppress
the deep sorrows of his Grace’s heart, and do violence to
himself, by accepting with patience and cheerfulness the
decrees of Providence”.<a name="FNanchor_171_171"
id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>In truth, not Henry alone, but the whole nation breathed
more freely, and the horror inspired by the injustice of Anne’s
trial cannot be said to have extended to any feeling of regret
for her untimely end. On the day of her execution, Chapuys,
keenly observant of all that went on at court, and of its effect
upon the nation, wrote:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>“The joy shown by this people every day, not only at
the ruin of the Concubine, but at the hope of the Princess
Mary’s restoration, is inconceivable, but as yet, the King
shows no great disposition towards the latter; indeed he
has twice shown himself obstinate, when spoken to on the
subject by his Council. I hear, that even before the arrest
of the Concubine, the King, speaking with Mistress Jane Semel
of their future marriage, the latter suggested that the Princess
should be replaced in her former position; and the King told
her she was a fool, and ought to solicit the advancement
of the children they would have between them, and not any
others. She replied, that by asking the restoration of the
Princess, she conceived she was seeking the rest and tranquillity
of the King, herself, her future children, and the whole
realm; for without that, neither your Majesty nor this people
would ever be content. Such a wish,” continues the ambassador,
“on the part of the said lady, is very commendable,
and I purpose using all means in my power, in keeping her
to her good intentions. I also mean to go to the King about
it two or three days hence, and visit one by one, the members
of the Privy Council, and if I can personally, or by means of
my friends, influence some of the lords and gentlemen, who
have been summoned for the next Parliament, which is to
meet on the 8th of next month, I shall not fail to do so.”<a name="FNanchor_172_172"
id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Chapuys did not exaggerate the nation’s joyful expectation
that Mary would be restored to favour, and that the
people would be allowed to enjoy the sight of her once more.
His testimony is corroborated in various ways, one of the
most striking proofs of her popularity being contained in
a French poem, written and printed in London in the beginning
of June 1536. This poem, which gives a singularly
accurate description of Anne Boleyn’s life, promotion and
disgrace, is highly eulogistic of Mary’s goodness and charms.
In expressing the universal satisfaction displayed at the
prospect of her speedy return to court, the writer continues:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse"><i>Et n’eussiez veu jusque aux petits enfans</i></div>
      <div class="verse"><i>Que tous chantans, et d’aise triomphans.</i></div>
      <div class="verse"><i>Il n’y a cueur si triste qui ne rye</i></div>
      <div class="verse"><i>En attendant la princesse Marie.</i></div>
      </div>
</div>

<p>It was impossible for Henry to ignore the immense popular
enthusiasm of which Mary was the object, and it hampered
him considerably, for he was not by any means prepared to
acknowledge himself in the wrong, by replacing her in his good
graces unconditionally. The desire of the nation, combined
with Jane’s influence and his own much-vaunted affection,
did not equal his obstinacy and vanity. Only, as the above-mentioned
poem goes on to relate, when the enthusiasm developed
into impatience, and a rumour was circulated that he
had sent for her, and had shown her kindness, did he realise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
that it might be prudent to reckon with the Londoners. Fearing
a disturbance, if he did not show some sign of relenting,
he sent them a condescending message, in which he thanked
them for their goodwill to him and his daughter, and held out
hopes of their speedy reconciliation.<a name="FNanchor_173_173"
id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>But Henry was still hedged in with difficulties, and he had
far more to consider than a mere peace-making with an eager,
affectionate daughter of twenty, whom all, except those whose
interest it was to keep them apart, agreed in praising. To
give Mary back her rights without terms, would be tantamount
to submission to the Pope, whose decree he had treated with
open scorn and defiance, to humbling himself before the
Emperor, after the haughty tone he had assumed in his letters
to him, and to climbing down in the eyes of his ally, the King
of France. And while on the one hand, he would be able to
secure a powerful friend by bestowing her on a candidate of
the Emperor, he would on the other, cease to be an important
factor in the game of European politics. His strength, he
knew, lay in temporising, in being considered a valuable
prize <i>in petto</i> to Francis and Charles alternately. If he
definitely gave himself up to Charles, he would but swell
the importance of the empire, at the sacrifice of his own pride.
The Emperor, when it became known that Anne’s fall was
imminent, made decided advances, promising “to be a mean
to reconcile him with the Pope”. He begged Henry to
legitimatise his daughter, and to give her a place in the
succession, and took the opportunity to request his help
against the Turk, slipping in a solicitation for his support,
in accordance with an existing treaty, in the event of an
invasion of the Duchy of Milan, by the French King.</p>

<p>Henry’s reply, through Chapuys, was lofty and cleverly
worded. The interruption of their friendship, he declared to
Pate, his ambassador at the imperial court, proceeded from the
Emperor, “who, although we made him King of Spain and
afterwards Emperor, when the empire was at our disposal,
and afterwards lent him money, so that he can thank only us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
for his present honor, has showed us all the ingratitude he
could devise, both in contemning our friendship, when we
have done more for his satisfaction in our proceedings than
needed, and in procuring injury and displeasure against us at
the hands of the Bishop of Rome; yet, if he will by his
express writings desire us to forget his unkind doings, or
declare that what we consider unkindness has been wrongly
imputed to him, we will gladly embrace the overture for the
renewal of amity; but as we have sustained the injury, we
would not be a suitor for reconciliation, nor treat of anything
till our amity is simply and without any conditions renewed.
If he will first accomplish this, he need not doubt that friendly
and reasonable answers will be given to all his reasonable
desires. To his overtures touching the Bishop of Rome, we
answered that we have not proceeded upon such slight grounds
that we could revoke or alter any part of our doing, having
made our foundation upon the laws of God, nature and
honesty, and established our works thereon, by the consent
of all the estates of our realm, in open and high court of
Parliament. A proposal has been made to us by the Bishop
of Rome himself, which we have not yet embraced, and it
would not be expedient to have it compassed by any other
means. We should not think the Emperor earnestly desired
a reconciliation with us, if he moved us to alter anything for
the satisfaction of the Bishop of Rome, our enemy. As to
the legitimatation of our daughter Mary, if she will submit to
our grace, without wrestling against the determination of our
laws, we will acknowledge her and use her as our daughter;
but we would not be directed or pressed herein, nor have any
other order devised for her entertainment, than should proceed
from the inclination of our own heart, being moved by her
humility, and the gentle proceedings of such as pretend to be
her friends. God has not only made us King by inheritance,
but has given us wisdom, policy, and other graces in most
plentiful sort, necessary for a prince to direct his affairs by,
to his honor and glory; and we doubt not, the Emperor
thinks it meet for us to order things here without search of
foreign advice, as for him or any other prince to determine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
their affairs without our counsel. We trust that we have
proceeded in all that we have enterprised with such circumspection,
that no one who looks with an indifferent eye upon
our foundation, which is God’s law, shall have cause to be
miscontented, but rather judge of us as a most Christian,
prudent, victorious and politic prince. If princes, by reason of
foreign marriages should be directed in the ordering of their
issue by the parents or allies of their wives, and, as it were,
controlled, as if they had committed themselves by such marriages
to other princes’ ‘<i>arbitres</i>,’ who can by no means
know the truth of their proceedings, the servitude thereof
would appear so great, that wisdom would allow no prince to
marry out of his realm. Notwithstanding such marriages,
princes have meddled but little in foreign affairs, unless the
title of inheritance has descended thereby to them. We doubt
not, that the Emperor will not intricate himself with our affairs
more than he honourably may, and agreeably to the amity
which should be between Christian princes.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174"
id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>To this the Emperor replied in a long letter, the conclusion
of which ran:—</p>

<p>“As to the Princess, our cousin, we also hold that the
King will act like a good and natural father, especially considering
her great virtues and good qualities; but our near
relationship, and the great worth of the said Princess, compel
us to urge the King to have a fatherly regard for her. Nor
does it seem unreasonable that kinsmen should intercede
with fathers for their children; and we do so all the more,
because we have always thought, that if the King has in any
degree withheld his favour from her, it has not been of his
own motion, but by sinister reports of others. So we think
he will take our intercession in good part, as we would do in
the case of our own children, of whom, if he consolidate this
amity, we shall consider him another father.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175"
id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor’s compliments with reference to Henry’s
“fatherly regard” for Mary were not altogether insincere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Her position had been made less humiliating in various ways.
In March, it was observed that Cromwell, in speaking of her,
put his hand to his cap, and the secretary, Pate, emboldened
by the turn affairs had taken, expressed his ardent desire that
the King “would not suffer that redolent flower to be deprived
of the sun’s warmth, and to wither away”.<a name="FNanchor_176_176"
id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The change was, no doubt, to be attributed to Jane
Seymour’s influence, as far as it went, but it was never very
great, her power never being equal to her will to help Mary,
who was not slow to perceive that a crisis was imminent; and
buoyed up with hope, as soon as an opportunity occurred, she
wrote to Cromwell:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Master Secretary</span>,</p>

<p class="indent-4">“I would have been a suter to you before this time,
to have been a mean for me to the King’s grace my father,
to have obtained his Grace’s blessing and favour; but I
perceived that nobody durst speak for me, as long as that
woman lived which now is gone, whom I pray our Lord of
his great mercy to forgive. Wherefore, now she is gone, I
am the bolder to write to you, as she which taketh you for
one of my chief friends. And, therefore, I desire you, for the
love of God, to be a suitor for me to the King’s grace, to have
his blessing, and licence to write unto his grace, which shall
be a great comfort for me, as God knoweth, who have you
evermore in his holy keeping. Moreover, I must desire you
to accept mine evil writing. For I have not done so much
this two year and more, nor could not have found the
meanes to do it at this time, but by my Lady Kingston’s
being here.</p>

<p>The series of letters which follow on this simple, natural
effusion are of so painful a character, that were it not necessary
for the clear understanding of the impending crisis in Mary’s
life, to print them here entire, the temptation would be great
to pass them over with a general indication of their contents.
But the matter is one that may not be dealt with superficially,
and the text of the somewhat discursive correspondence which
passed between Mary, Cromwell and Henry is indispensable
if we would estimate the extent of the mental torture the
Princess was called upon to undergo, at the very time when
she hoped that her worst trials were over. Her father’s
tyranny, far from having exhausted its resources, culminated
in an act so brutal, that it removes him for ever beyond the
pale of humanity. It is a question whether, in all Mary’s
sad and troubled life, the saddest moment was not now
approaching. Gradually, the bright, eager tone of her letters
dies down, and, in place of the hopeful strain, is one of abject
grovelling at Henry’s feet. The later letters of the series are,
indeed, written either from Cromwell’s dictation, or are copied
from his drafts, but the pen is Mary’s; and the fact that she
was now brought to renounce, at least formally, her birthright,
her pious faith in her mother’s honour and dignity, together
with all that she held most dear, places her in a position than
which there could hardly be a more painful. But nothing
short of this total abandonment of herself to his despotic will
would satisfy the “most Christian, prudent, victorious and
politic prince,” her father.<a name="FNanchor_178_178"

<p>Cromwell’s answer to the above letter has not been preserved,
but its tenor may be inferred by another from the
Princess Mary, dated the 30th May:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Master Secretary</span>,</p>

<p class="indent-4">“In as hearty manner as I can devise, I recommend
me unto you, as she which thinketh her self much bound unto
you, for the great pain and labour that you have taken for me,
and specially for obtaining of the King my father’s blessing
and licence to write unto his Grace; which are two of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
highest comforts that ever came to me: desiring you of your
gentle and friendly continuance in your suit for me, wherein
(next unto God) I trust you shall find me as obedient to the
King’s grace as you can reasonably require of me. Wherefore
I have a great hope in your goodness, that by your wisdom,
help and means, his Grace shall not only withdraw his displeasure,
but also that it may like his Grace (if it may stand
with his gracious pleasure) to licence me to come into his
presence, for the which I pray you in the honour of God to
be a continual suitor for me, when your discretion shall think
the time most convenient. For it is the thing which I ever
have and do desire above all worldly things. And in all
these things, good Mr. Secretary, for the love of him that all
comfort sendeth, I beseech you to be my most humble petitioner,
and that in like case (I take God to be my Judge) I
would be for you, if the same did lie in my power. And thus
I must desire you to accept this short and evil written letter.
For the rheum in my head will suffer me to write no more at
this time. Wherefore I pray you in all things to give credence
to this bearer; and with this end I commit you to
Almighty God, whom I shall pray to be with you in everything
that you go about. From Hounsden, the 30 day of

<p>In accordance with the permission obtained, two days
later Mary wrote to her father:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In as humble and lowly a manner as is possible for a
child to use to her father and sovereign Lord, I beseech your
Grace of your daily blessing, which is my chief desire in this
world. And in the same humble wise knowledging all the
offences that I have done to your Grace, since I had first discretion
to offend unto this hour, I pray your Grace, in the
honour of God, and for your fatherly pity to forgive me them;
for the which I am as sorry as any creature living; and next
unto God, I do and will submit me in all things to your goodness

and pleasure, to do with me whatsoever shall please your
Grace, humbly beseeching your Highness to consider that I
am a woman and your child, who hath committed her soul
to God, and her body to be ordered in this world, as it shall
stand with your pleasure; whose order and direction, whatsoever
it shall please your Highness to limit and direct to me
I shall most humbly and willingly stand content to follow,
obey and accomplish in all points. And so in the lowliest
manner that I can, I beseech your Grace to accept me, your
humble daughter, which doth not a little rejoice to hear the
comfortable tidings, not only to me, but to all your Grace’s
realm, concerning the marriage which is between your Grace
and the Queen, now being your Grace’s wife, my mother-in-law.
The hearing whereof caused nature to constrain me to
be an humble suitor to your Grace, to be so good and gracious
Lord and father to me, as to give me leave to wait upon the
Queen, and to do her Grace such service as shall please her to
command me, which my heart shall be as ready and obedient
to fulfill (next unto your Grace) as the most humble servant
that she hath. Trusting in your Grace’s mercy to come into
your presence, which ever hath and shall be the greatest
comfort that I can have within this world; having also a full
hope in your Grace’s natural pity, which you have allwayes
used as much or more than any Prince christened, that your
Grace will show the same upon me your most humble and
obedient daughter; who daily prayeth God to have your
Grace in his holy keeping, with a long life, and as much
honour as ever had king, and to send your Grace shortly a
Prince, whereof no creature living shall more rejoice or
heartlier pray for continually than I, as my duty bindeth me.</p>

</p></div>

<p>Humble as were these petitions, they elicited no reply
from Henry, and Mary waited in vain for a word of kindness.
Gradually it was borne in upon her, that the favour which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
she so earnestly implored, and which seemed to her so simple
and easy a thing for the King to grant, would only be bestowed
at the price of a sacrifice too heavy for her conscience to bear.
Her contrition for past offences must not only be general,
and such as any child might express to any father, but circumstantial
and precise, affecting the vital principles for
which she had struggled for four years. On the 6th June,
Chapuys told the Emperor, that in an interview with Cromwell,
the Secretary had declared it to be absolutely necessary
that Mary should write a letter, according to a draft which
he (Cromwell) had prepared, “in the most honourable and
reasonable form that could be”. He had, he said, by the
King’s command, sent a very confidential lady to solicit the
Princess to do this, and that to avoid scruple, he wished that
Chapuys would write to her, and send one of his principal
servants to persuade her to make no difficulties about writing
the said letter, which he intended to have translated from
English into Latin, that Chapuys might see that it was quite
honourable. There was, Chapuys thought, “some bird-catching
attempted,” and he warned Mary. But meanwhile
Cromwell visited him at his lodging, and told him that the
King and Queen were wonderfully well pleased at the letters
which Mary had written, in which, however, the ambassador
told Charles that there was nothing corresponding to Cromwell’s
draft, nor anything that could prejudice her.</p>

<p>Mary’s next two letters, the one addressed to the chief
Secretary, the other to Henry, dated respectively the 7th and
8th June, were evidently written in an agony of suspense,
and of that hope deferred which “afflicteth the soul”.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The above is the last of this series of letters which Mary
wrote to her father without help or suggestion from Cromwell.
Abject as was the tone of them all, Cromwell, anxious, for
reasons of his own, to make peace between Henry and his
daughter, saw clearly that this would not be effected, unless
she could be brought categorically to declare herself illegitimate.
The King was determined on it, in order that failing
legitimate male issue, he might have some show of reason for
putting his natural son, the Duke of Richmond, forward as
his successor. This project could be furthered by nothing
that she had hitherto written, and the chief Secretary now
began to give her advice as to the wording of her appeals.
The result of this advice was a letter written on the 10th
June, the beginning and end of which were little else than
repetitions of her former expressions of sorrow for past offences,
desire for forgiveness and admission into the King’s “most
noble presence”. But in the middle occurs this sentence:
“Eftsoones therefore, most humbly prostrate before your
noble feet, your most obedient subject and humble child,
that hath not only repented her offences hitherto, but also
decreed simply from henceforth and wholly <i>next to Almighty
God</i>, to put my state, continuance and living in your gracious
mercy, and likewise to accept the condition of your disposition
and appointment, whatsoever it shall be”.<a name="FNanchor_183_183"
id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>This letter she sent to Cromwell with the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Good Master Secretary</span>,</p>

<p>“I do send you by this bearer, my servant, both the
King’s highness’ letter sealed, and the copy of the same again

your advice and counsell, and will do in all things concerning

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
offended) for I take you for one of my chief friends, next
unto his Grace and the Queen. Wherefore, I desire you, for
the passion which Christ suffered for you and me, and as my
very trust is in you, that you will find such meanes through
your great wisdome, that I be not moved to agree to any
further entry in this matter than I have done. For I assure
you, by the faith that I owe to God, I have done the uttermost

desire nor intend to do less than I have done. But if I be
put to any more (I am plain with you as with my great friend)
my said conscience will in no wayes suffer me to consent
thereunto. And this point except, you nor any other shall
be so much desirous to have me obey the King, as I shall be
ready to fulfill the same. For I promise you (as I desire
God to help me at my most need) I had rather loose the life
of my body, than displease the King’s Grace willingly. Sir,
I beseech you for the love of God to take in good worth this
rude letter. For I would not have troubled you so much at
this time, but that the end of your letter caused me a little
to fear that I shall have more business hereafter. And thus
I commit you to God, whom I do and shall dayly pray to be
with you in everything that you go about. From Hownsdon
the x. of June.</p>

<p>Mary’s surmises were correct. “More business” was pending,
and meanwhile her letters only gave dissatisfaction. The
contents of Cromwell’s answer to the above can be gathered
from the Princess’s letter of the 13th June.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Good Mr. Secretary</span>,</p>

<p>“I do thank you with all my heart, for the great pain
and suit you have had for me. For the which I think myself
very much bound to you. And whereas I do perceive by your
letters, that you do mislike mine exception in my letter to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the King’s Grace, I assure you, I did not mean as you do take
it. For I do not mistrust that the King’s goodness will move
me to do anything which should offend God and my conscience.
But that which I did write was only by the reason of continual
custome. For I have allwayes used, both in writing and
speaking, to except God in all things.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, because you have exhorted me to write to
his Grace again, and I cannot devise what I should write more
but your own last copy, without adding or minishing; therefore
I do send you by this bearer, my servant, the same, word
for word; and it is unsealed, because I cannot endure to write
another copy. For the pain in my head and teeth hath
troubled me so sore these two or three dayes, and doth yet so
continue, that I have very small rest, day or night. Wherefore
I trust in your goodness, that you will accept this, and find
such meanes by your wisdome, that the King’s Grace may do
the same. Which thing I desire you in the honour of God to
procure, as my very trust is in you. For I know none to make
suit unto, nor to ask counsell of but only you, whom I commit
to God, desiring him to help you in all your business. From
Hounsdon the 13 day of June (1536).</p>

<p>Cromwell’s draft, which the Princess copied “word for

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In my most humble and lowly manner, beseeching your
Graces dayly blessing. Forasmuch as sithens it pleased your
most gracious mercy upon mine hearty repentance for mine
offences and trespasses to your Majestie, and mine humble
and simple submission to the same, of my life, state and
condition, to be gladly received at your Highness hand and
appointment, whatsoever the same shall think convenient for
me, without the remainder of any will in myself, but such as
shall be instilled from the most noble mouth of your excellent
Majestie, to grant me licence to write unto you: albeit I have
written twice unto your highness, trusting to have, by some
gracious letters, token or message, perceived sensibly the mercy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
clemency and pity of your Grace, and upon the operation of
the same, at the last also to have attained the fruition of your
most noble presence, which above all worldly things I desire:
yet I have not obtained my said fervent and hearty desire, ne
any peice of the same to my great and intolerable discomfort
I am enforced, by the compulsion of nature, eftsones to cry unto
your mercifull eares, and most humbly prostrate before your
feet, to beseech your Grace to have pity and compassion of
me, and in such wise to put apart your displeasure, justly
conceived against me, as I may feel some piece of your most
abundant grace, that hath never wanted to them that have
inwardly repented their offences, not committed by malice,
but by yonghe frailty and ignorance. For yet I remain almost
void of all hope, saving the confidence I have in your blessed
nature recomforteth me. And therefore eftsones, prostrate at
your noble feet I beseech your Majestie to countervail my
transgressions with my repentance for the same, and thereupon
to grant some little spark of my most humble suit and
desire, which (God is my judge) I desire for no worldly respect,
trusting in Almighty God, to use myself so from henceforth
as your Grace shall have cause to think your mercy and pity
well extended unto me. To whom I shall daily pray (as I
am most bounden) to preserve your Highness, with the Queen,
and shortly to send you issue, which shall be gladder tidings
to me than I can express in writing.</p>

<p>It was clearly anticipated that Mary’s progress, by almost
imperceptible degrees, from vague expressions of repentance
to a definite surrender of her will for the future, would have
prepared the victim for the final <i>coup</i>. Immediately after
receiving the above transcript of Cromwell’s draft, Henry sent
commissioners to Hunsdon, summoning her to accept the new
statute, and to affix her signature to a statement, declaring her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
own illegitimacy, which had been drawn up with the most
ruthless and humiliating detail.</p>

<p>To Henry’s fury and Cromwell’s consternation Mary refused
to sign. The Chief Secretary had pledged himself to reduce
her to submission, and he knew by experience, that with his
master, failure spelt treason, and he trembled accordingly.
His answer to Mary’s appeals was brutal in the extreme, yet
knowing as we do by the light of after events, that he was not
only arrested, but condemned and executed for far less than
complicity in Mary’s disobedience, we can scarcely wonder at
his tone towards her. None, with the single exception perhaps
of Cranmer, knew Henry so well as his chief minister, and to
know him was with all time-servers to fear exceedingly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span> [he wrote],</p>

<p>“I have received your letters, whereby it appeareth
you be in great discomfort, and do desire that I should find the
means to speak with you. For answer whereunto, ye shall
understand, that how great so ever your discomfort is, it can
be no greater than mine, who hath upon your letters spoken
so much of your repentance for your wilfull obstinacy against
the King’s Highness, and of your humble submission in all
things, without exception and qualification, to obey to his
pleasure and laws, that knowing how diversely and contrarily
you proceeded at the late being of his Majesty’s counsell with
you, I am both ashamed of that I have said, and likewise afraid
of that I have done; in so much that what the sequel thereof shall
be God knoweth. Thus with your folly you undoe yourself, and
all that hath wished your good; and yet I will say unto you, as
I have said else where heretofore; that it were great pity ye
should not be an example in a punishment, if ye will make yourself
an example in the contempt of God, your natural father
and his lawes, by your own only fantasie, contrary to the judgements
and determinations of all men, that ye must confess
do know and love God as well as you, except you will show
yourself presumption. [Hearne says: “Evidently a mistake
for presumptuous as in the margin of Dr. Smith’s copy”.]
Wherefore, Madam, to be plain with you, as God is my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
witnes, like as I think you the most obstinate and obdurate
woman all things considered, that ever was, and one that so
persevering, well deserveth the reward of malice in extremity
of mischief: so I dare not open my lips to name you, unless I
may have such a ground thereunto, that it may appear you
were mistaken, or at least that you be both repentant for
your ingratitude and miserable unkindness, and ready to
do all things that ye be bound unto by your duty of allegiance,
if nature were secluded from you, and in a like degree
planted in the same, as it is in every other common subject.
And therefore, I have sent unto you a certain book of articles
whereunto if you will sett your name, you shall undoubtedly
please God, being the same conformable to his truth, so
as you will in semblable manner conceive it in your heart
without dissimulation. Upon the receipt whereof again from
you, with a letter declaring that you think in heart that you
have subscribed with hand, I shall eftsones adventure to
speak for your reconciliation. And if you will not with
speed leave all your sinister counsells, which have brought
you to the point of utter undoing, without remedy, and herein
follow mine advice, I take my leave of you for ever, and desire
you never to write or make mean unto me hereafter. For I
will never think you other than the most ungrateful, unnatural
and most obstinate person living, both to God and your
most dear and benign father. And I advise you to nothing,
but I beseech God never to help me, if I know it not so
certainly to be your bounden duty, by God’s laws and man’s
laws, that I must needs judge that person that shall refuse
it, not meet to live in a Christian congregation; to the
witness whereof I take Christ, whose mercy I refuse, if I
write anything unto you that I have not professed in my
heart and know to be true.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186"

<p>We are indebted to Chapuys’ letter to the Emperor, dated
1st July 1536, for a detailed account of the matter that had
excited Cromwell’s ire.</p>

<p>“When the Princess, having written several good letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
to the King her father and to this Queen, expected to be
out of her trouble, trusting to the hope held out to her,
she found herself in the most extreme perplexity and danger
she had ever been in, and not only herself, but all her
principal friends. The King, seven or eight days after the
departure of the man whom I sent to your Majesty, took
a fancy to insist that the Princess should consent to his
statutes, or he would proceed by rigour of law against her,
and to induce her to yield, sent to her the duke of Norfolk,
the earl of Sussex, the bishop of Chester and certain others,
whom she confounded by her wise and prudent answers,
till they, seeing that they could not conquer her in argument,
told her that since she was so unnatural as to oppose
the King’s will so obstinately, they could scarcely believe
she was his bastard, and if she was their daughter, they
would beat her and knock her head so violently against
the wall, that they would make it as soft as baked apples,
and that she was a traitress and should be punished, and
several other words. And her
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernante</span></i> was commanded
not to allow any one to speak to her, and that she and
another should never lose sight of her, day or night. Nevertheless,
the said Princess found means to send me immediate
information of everything, begging me not to leave her
without counsel in her extreme necessity.</p>

<p>“On this I wrote to her very fully, telling her among other
things, that she must make up her mind, if the King persisted
in his obstinacy, or she found evidence that her life was in
danger, either by maltreatment or otherwise, to consent to her
father’s wish, assuring her that such was your advice, and that
to save her life, on which depended the peace of the realm, and
the redress of the great evils which prevail here, she must do
everything, and dissemble for some time, especially, as the
protestations made, and the cruel violence shown her, preserved
her rights inviolate, and likewise her conscience, seeing
that nothing was required expressly against God, or the
articles of the Faith, and God regarded more the intention
than the act; and that now she had more occasion to do
thus than during the life of the Concubine, as it was proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to deprive the Bastard, and make her heiress; and I felt
assured that if she came to Court, she would by her wisdom
set her father again in the right road, to which the intercession
of your Majesty through the reconciliation and
establishment of amity would conduce.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187"
id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>The King suspected that Mary was advised to hold out by
certain of her attendants, and made strict inquiries. Several
of her ladies were called before the Council, and made to
swear to the statutes. The wife of her Chamberlain, whom
Chapuys designates as “one of the most virtuous ladies in
England,” was sent to the Tower, while Mary’s chief confidential
servant was detained for two days in Cromwell’s
house. The Council sat for six or seven days from morning
till night without intermission, deliberating on Mary’s fate.
Cromwell, suspected of having shown himself too favourable
to the Princess, was not free from danger. He told Chapuys
that for four or five days he looked upon himself as a lost man
and dead. The Marquis of Exeter and the Lord Treasurer,
Fitzwilliam, were dismissed from the Council as Mary’s friends,
and the new Queen, Jane Seymour, was rudely repulsed for
speaking in her favour. Continuing the above letter, Chapuys
said:—</p>

<p>“The judges, in spite of threats, refused to decide, and
advised that a writing should be sent to the Princess, and
that if she refused to sign it they should proceed against her.
The Princess being informed from various quarters how
matters stood, signed the document without reading it. For
her better excuse, I had previously sent her the form of the
protestation she must make apart. I had also warned her
that she must in the first place secure the King’s pardon, and,
if possible, not give her approval to the said statutes, except
so far as she could do so agreeably to God and her conscience,
or that she should promise only not to infringe the said
statute, without expressing approval. I have not yet ascertained
how the thing has passed, but, in any case, she never
made a better day’s work, for if she had let this opportunity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
slip, there was no remedy in the world for her. As soon as
the news arrived of her subscription, incredible joy was shown
in all the Court, except by the earl of Essex, who told the
King that was a game that would cost him his head, for the
injurious language he had used against the Princess. After
the Princess had signed the document she was much dejected,
but I immediately relieved her of every doubt even of conscience,
assuring her that the Pope would not only not impute
to her any blame, but would hold it rightly done. Since the
Princess subscribed the said document, the King sent back
the above commissioners with others, among whom was
Master Cromwell, who was charged by the King to carry to
her a most gracious letter, and also, according to the custom
of the country, another with the paternal blessing, and they
all offered her the highest possible honour, addressing her
almost continually kneeling upon the ground, especially
asking her pardon for their previous conduct. The Princess
remains very happy, especially on account of the goodwill
Cromwell bears her in the promotion of her affairs. She is
only anxious as to how your Majesty will be satisfied with
what she has done. And now that she has done it, on my
assurance that it was the will of your Majesty, yet it would be
a marvellous consolation to her to know it by letters from
you. She has also desired me to write to your Majesty’s
ambassador at Rome, to procure a secret absolution from the
Pope, otherwise her conscience could not be at perfect ease.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188"
id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>The document to which Henry finally summoned his
daughter to affix her signature was drawn up in the following
terms:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<p>“The confession of me the Lady Mary, made upon certain
points and articles under written, in the which as I do now
plainly and with all mine heart confess and declare mine
inward sentence, belief and judgment, with a due conformity
of obedience to the laws of the realm; so minding for ever to
persist and continue in this determination, without change,
alteration or varyance, I do most humbly beseech the King’s
Highness, my father, whom I have obstinately and inobediently
offended in the denyal of the same heretofore, to forgive mine
offences therein, and to take me to his most gracious mercy.
First, I confess and knowledge the King’s Majesty to be my
Soveraign Lord and King, in the imperial Crown of this realme
of England, and do submit myself to his Highness, and to all
and singular lawes and statutes of this realm, as becometh
a true and faithfull subject to do; which I shall also obey,
keep, observe, advance and maintain, according to my
bounden duty, with all the power, force and qualities that
God hath induced me, during my life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>”<i>Item.</i>—I do recognize, accept, take, repute and knowledge
the King’s Highness to be supream head in earth under
Christ of the Church of England, and do utterly refuse the
Bishop of Rome’s pretended authority, power and jurisdiction
within this Realm heretofore usurped, according to the laws
and statutes made in that behalf, and of all the King’s true
subjects, humbly received, admitted, obeyed, kept and observed.
And also do utterly renounce and forsake all manner
of remedy, interest and advantage which I may by any means
claim by the Bishop of Rome’s laws, process, jurisdiction or
sentence, at this present time or in any wise hereafter, by any
manner, title, colour, mean or case that is, shall, or can be
devised for that purpose.</p>

<p class="ar">
“<span class="smcap">Marye.</span><br />
</p>

<p>”<i>Item.</i>—I do freely, frankly and for the discharge of my
duty towards God, the King’s Highness and his laws, without
other respect, recognize and acknowledge that the marriage
heretofore had between his Majesty and my mother, the late
Princess dowager, was by God’s law and man’s law incestuous
and unlawfull.</p>

<p class="ar">
“<span class="smcap">Marye.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_189_189"
id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a><br />
</p></div>

<p>Thus was the great renunciation made. It was probably
the worst thing that Mary did in her whole life, for there is
nothing in her history on record to compare with this violation
of her conscience, and of all that she held most sacred. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
excuse her on the score that she never gave interior consent
to the sacrifice of her mother’s honour and her own faith
would be but a miserable apology. She yielded indeed less
to Cromwell’s threats, than to the Emperor’s specious arguments,
and to the wretchedness of her own forlorn condition;
but her intellect and mental and moral training were such
that she was able to appreciate to the full the extent of her
fall, and it would be doing her a poor service to attempt to
palliate her guilt.</p>

<p>Cromwell prepared yet another letter for the hapless victim
to copy, for having drunk the bitter cup to the dregs, she was
now required to thank her father humbly for the boon. The
passionless utilitarian mind of the Chief Secretary was not bent
on causing Mary more pain than was necessary to bring about
and perfect the reconciliation which he had set himself to
accomplish. He was not wantonly cruel; but he understood
Henry, and knew that neither his own head nor Mary’s was
safe, until the royal vanity was fed to repletion. He therefore
caused her to write the following letter to her father on
the 15th June, after having signed the articles:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Most humbly prostrate before the feet of your most
excellent Majestie, your most humble, faithfull and obedient
subject, which hath so extremely offended your most gracious
Highness that mine heavy and fearfull heart dare not presume
to call you father, ne your Majesty hath any cause by my
deserts, saving the benignity of your most blessed nature
doth surmount all evils, offences and trespasses, and is ever
mercifull and ready to accept the penitent calling for grace
in any convenient time. Having received this thursday at
night certain letters from Mr. Secretary, as well advising me
to make mine humble submission immediately to your self,
which because I durst not without your gracious licence
presume to do before I lately sent unto him, as signifying
that your most mercifull heart and fatherly pity had granted
me your blessing, with condition that I should persevere in
that I had commenced and begun, and that I should not
eftsones offend your Majesty by the denyal or refusal of any
such articles and commandments as it may please your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Highness to address unto me for the perfect tryal of mine
heart and inward affection. For the perfect declaration of
the bottom of my heart and stomack, first I knowledge my
self to have most unkindly and unnaturally offended your
most excellent Highness, in that I have not submitted myself
to your most just and vertuous laws, and for mine offence
therein, which I must confess were in me a thousand fold
more grievous, than they could be in any other living creature.
I put my self wholly and entirely to your gracious mercy, at
whose hand I cannot receive that punishment for the same
that I have deserved. Secondly, to open mine heart to your
Grace in these things which I have hitherto refused to condescend
unto, and have now written with mine own hand
sending the same to your Highness herewith. I shall never
beseech your Grace to have pity and compassion of me, if
ever you shall perceive that I shall prevyly or apertly vary
or alter from one peice of that I have written and subscribed,
or refuse to confirm, ratifie or declare the same where your
Majesty shall appoint me. Thirdly, as I have and shall,
knowing your excellent learning, virtue, wisdom and knowledge,
put my soul into your direction, and by the same hath
and will in all things from henceforth direct my conscience,
so my body I do wholly commit to your mercy and fatherly
pity; desiring no state, no condition nor no manner degree
of living, but such as your Grace shall appoint unto me;
knowledging and confessing that my state cannot be so vile
as either the extremity of justice would appoint unto me,
or as my offences have required and deserved; and whatsoever
your Grace shall command me to do, touching any of
these points, either for things past, present or to come, I
shall as gladly do the same as your Majesty can command
me. Most humbly therefore, beseeching your mercy, most
gracious soveraign Lord and benign father, to have pity and
compassion of your miserable and sorrowfull child, and with
the abundance of your inestimable goodness to overcome
mine iniquities towards God, your Grace, and your whole
realm, as I may feel some sensible token of reconciliation,
which, God is my Judge, I only desire without any respect.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
To whom I shall dayly pray for the preservation of your
Highness, with the Queen’s grace, and that it may please him
to send you issue. From Hownsdon at 11 of the clock at
night. Your grace’s most humble and obedient daughter

</p></div>

<p>Henry was now pleased to accept Mary’s holocaust, and
intimated to her his forgiveness. Cromwell’s hand is again
evident in her reply. Even now, if left to her own expressions
of affection, she might fail to attain to the proper
degree of servility. On the 26th June she wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Most humbly, obediently and gladly, lying at the feet
of your most excellent Majesty, my most dear and benigne
soveraigne Lord. I have this day perceived your gracious
clemency and mercifull pity to have overcome my most
unkind and unnatural proceedings towards you and your
most just and vertuous lawes; the great and inestimable joy,
whereof I cannot express ne have any thing worthy to be
again presented to your Majesty for the same your fatherly
pity extended towards me, most ingrately on my part
abandoned, as much as in me lay; but my poor heart, which
I send unto your Highness, to remain in your hand, to be
for ever used, directed and framed, whiles God shall suffer
life to remain in it, at your only pleasure; most humbly
beseeching your Grace to accept and receive the same, being
all that I have to offer, which shall never alter, vary or
change from that confession and submission which I have
made unto your Highness in the presence of your council
and others attending upon the same; for whose preservation
with my most gracious mother the Queen, I shall daily pray
to God, whom eftsones I beseech to send you issue, to his
honour and the comfort of your whole realm.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">1536-1537.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Amid</span> all the fencing and diplomatic insincerities that went
on between Henry and Charles, concerning Mary’s status,
his cousin’s real welfare had but a small share in the policy
of the Emperor. Persecuted by her father, Mary had taken
counsel with the powerful kinsman who, she thought, had her
interests, and the cause for which she was suffering, at heart.
But Charles was a much better politician than kinsman, and
had no cause so much at heart as his own advantage, and that
of the empire. He was anxious to be at peace with Henry
for more reasons than one, and cared little what temporary
concessions his cousin made, so long as they furthered this
object. He had not seen his way to make war, when she and
her mother had looked to him as their avenger, and now that
the principal cause of estrangement between himself and
Henry had been removed by death, he was eager to sacrifice
Mary on the altar of peace. Her eyes were never opened
to the treacherous part he had played, but Henry was not
ignorant of the fact that she was entirely influenced by the
Emperor. If she had yielded, he knew that she had done so
with Charles’s approval, a circumstance that made largely for
political amity. The days of chivalry were done, and Mary’s
trust and confidence were ruthlessly employed to pave a way
out of the imperial difficulties.</p>

<p>Great stress was laid by Charles on the axiom, that concessions
extracted by force or fraud had no binding power,
so long as formal protests against the compulsion exercised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
were secretly made and signed. This principle was frequently
applied between the three chief rulers of Europe at this period,
and sometimes led to curious results.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mary was not yet in calm waters. Cromwell,
for the sake of his own safety, required her to express in a letter
addressed to him, but intended for Henry’s eye, all that she
owed him as a mediator. He had not forgotten what he had
undergone, during the six days’ uninterrupted sitting of the
Council, when he had considered himself “a dead man,” and
when, in fact, his own and Mary’s fate had trembled in the
balance. Even yet, his capricious master might again suspect
him of having encouraged Mary in her resistance, and he was
anxious that there should be no mistake in Henry’s mind, as to
his share in her submission. Besides this, the King’s tyranny
required a declaration from Mary, that she not only abandoned
her title but agreed in its being given to Anne’s daughter
Elizabeth (although she, too, had been declared illegitimate
and was not allowed to use it any longer), and that as to her
own future position she made no claim, but was content to
accept whatever was conceded. Another point left vague had
been her attitude respecting Henry’s disposal of doctrines,
which concerned purgatory, pilgrimages, relics, etc., and her
father must be satisfied in this matter also. Having swallowed
the whole, Mary made no further resistance as to the parts, and
wrote to Cromwell as he desired, probably copying his entire
draft.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Good Master Secretary</span>,</p>

<p>“How much am I bound unto you, which hath not
only travailed, when I was almost drowned in folly to recover me
before I sunk and was utterly past recovery, and so to present
me to the fire of grace and mercy, but also desisteth not
sithence with your good and wholsome counsels, so to arme
me from any relapse, that I cannot, unless I were too wilfull
and obstinate, whereof there is now no spark in me, fall again
into any danger! But leaveing the recital of your goodness
apart, which I cannot recount, for answer to the particulerities
of your credence, sent by my friend Master Wrythesley;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
first concerning the Princess (so I think I must call her yet
for I would be loath to offend) I offered at her entry to that
name and honour, to call her sister; but it was refused, unless
I would also add the other title unto it, which I denyed not
then more obstinately than I am now sorry for it; for that I
did therein offend my most gracious father and his just lawes,
and now that you think it meet, I shall never call her by any
other name than sister. Touching the nomination of such
women as I would have about me, surely Mr. Secretary, what
men or women soever the King’s Highness shall appoint to
wait on me, without exception, shall be unto me right
heartily, and without respect welcome; albeit to express my
mind to you, whom I think worthy to be accepted for their
faithfull service done to the King’s Majestie and to me,
sythens they came into my company, I promise you on my
faith, Margery Baynton and Susan Clarcencyeus have in
every condition used themselves as faithfully, painfully and
diligently as ever did women in such a case; as sorry when
I was not so conformable, as became me, as glad when I
enclined anything to my duty, as could be devised. One
other there is, that was sometime my maid, whom for her
vertue I love, and could be glad to have in my company, that
is Mary Brown; and here be all that I will recommend; and
yet, my estimation of these shall be measured at the King’s
Highness, my most mercifull father’s pleasure and appointment,
as reason is. For mine opinion touching pilgrimages,
purgatory, relicks and such like, I assure you, I have none at
all, but such as I shall receive from him, that hath mine whole
heart in keeping, that is the King’s most gracious Highness,
my most benign father, who shall imprint in the same touching
these matters and all other, what his inestimable vertue, high
wisdome and excellent learning shall think convenient, and
limit unto me; to whose presence I pray God I may once
come or I dye. For every day is a year, till I may have the
fruition of it. Beseeching you, good Mr. Secretary, to continue
mine humble sute for the same, and for all other things
whatsoever they be, to repute mine heart so firmly knit to his
pleasure, that I can by no mean vary from the direction and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
appointment of the same. And thus most heartily fare you
well.</p>

<p>Henry was at last pleased to forgive her, and by common
consent, Cromwell had all the credit of the peacemaking.
Chapuys told Cardinal Perrenot de Granvelle, President of
the Emperor’s Council, that the Secretary was also doing his
best to promote friendship between their masters, and that,
having carried it into effect, he would die proud of that feat,
and of having reconciled the Princess to her father, “not
wishing to live one day longer”. On the 6th July, Chapuys
applied for an audience with the King for the next day, but
was told that he could not then have one, as both the King
and Queen were to visit the Princess secretly. Cromwell
added that it would be far better for the advancement of
business, if Chapuys spoke to him after his return, “knowing
well that after seeing the beauty, goodness, prudence and
virtue of the same Princess, the King would be more inclined
to the matter in question”. The letter in which this news
is communicated then breaks off, and later on Chapuys
continues:—</p>

<p>“The day before yesterday (6th inst.) the King and Queen
left this, with a small and secret company to visit the Princess,
three miles from here, where they remained till yesterday
about vespers. The kindness shown by the King to the
Princess was inconceivable, regretting that he had been so
long separated from her. He made good amends for it in
the little time he was with her, continually talking with her,
with every sign of affection, and with ever so many fine
promises. The Queen gave her a beautiful diamond, and the
King about 1000 crowns in money for her little pleasures, telling
her to have no anxiety about money, for she should have
as much as she could wish. He promised her that when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
returned from Dover, she should come to court. She will no
doubt by her great prudence remedy many things.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193"
id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>On the same day, however, he had cause to modify this
account somewhat, in a subsequent letter to Granvelle, in
which he says:—</p>

<p>“What I have told his Majesty about this King’s singularly
kind behaviour to his daughter the Princess, when he
saw her the other day, I have on the authority of one of
her own servants, the very same one who, for some time
past, has been the bearer of her messages to me. Yesterday,
as he was imparting the said news, and conveying his
mistress’s commendations to me, I naturally concluded that
he himself was speaking in the Princess’s name, but I am
afraid such is not the case, and that the man only repeated
what he had heard, for I have since been told, that mixed
with the sweet food of paternal kindness, there were a few
drachmas of gall and bitterness. But after all, we must set
that down to paternal authority, and pray God to inspire the
King to behave still better to the Princess, and work with
more zest and sincerity than he has hitherto done, towards
the establishment and extension of the confederacy with your
Majesty, which, as may be gathered from my previous despatches,
has hitherto been surrounded by much artifice and
subterfuge.”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194"
class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Henry was much perplexed as to the exact position Mary
was to occupy thenceforth. Cromwell told Chapuys that “the
great and almost excessive love and affection that the English
have always shown for the Princess” had so increased of
late, that they were determined to risk everything for her
sake. This attitude of the people roused her father’s jealousy
and suspicion, and Cromwell was observed no longer to give
her her title, a habit which he had already resumed. He
not only avoided speaking of Mary as Princess, but requested
Chapuys to do the same, which made him think that instead
of declaring her to be Princess of Wales, she would be called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Duchess of York. “Considering,” continued Cromwell, “the
King’s versatility and, on the other hand, the rumours current
among the people, I hesitate to say what the Princess’s future
is likely to be; but this I can assure you (Chapuys), that the
whole business will be conducted to her honor and profit”—“giving
me,” said the ambassador, “to understand thereby
that she will be appointed heiress to the Crown, should the
King have no male issue.”</p>

<p>On the 22nd July, the Duke of Richmond died of consumption,
and Mary’s prospects immediately brightened. Chapuys
informed the Emperor of the fact, assuring him that the Princess
had plenty of company, “even of the following of the little
Bastard who will henceforth pay her court”. Her household
had not yet been appointed, but nothing was wanting
except her name and title of princess. “Nor need we make
too much of the name,” said Chapuys, “seeing that it has not
been usual to give such a title to a daughter, while there is
any hope of male issue, and the Cardinal, for some particular
reasons, had broken that custom in her case. Nevertheless,
Cromwell says, that title will be restored to her before many
days, and there is no doubt, if she comes to court, she will
have that, and everything she can desire, for her incomparable
beauty, grace and prudence. And I think that your Majesty’s
affairs will proceed all the better for it; at all events, it will
not be for want of goodwill that your affairs do not go on
more prosperously than her own. I sent lately to warn the
Princess, that there was some talk of marrying her in this
kingdom to some very unsuitable person [perhaps he means
to Cromwell, who had been suggested as a possible husband
for her], and she sent to assure me, that she would never
make any match without the express consent of your Majesty;
protesting that except for some great advantage to the peace
of Christendom, she would not care to be married at all.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195"

<p>Chapuys could never admire and praise Mary enough.
Even in communicating officially the news of the Duke of
Richmond’s death, eulogy of the Princess formed the chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
part of his despatch. “Few are sorry,” he wrote to Perrenot
de Granvelle, “because of the Princess. Even Cromwell has
congratulated her in his letters, and thank God, she now
triumphs, and it is to be hoped that the dangers are laid, with
which she has been surrounded, to make her a paragon of
virtue, goodness, honor and prudence: I say nothing of
beauty and grace, for it is incredible. May God raise her
soon to the Crown, for the benefit of his Majesty and of all
Christendom.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196"
class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>Those who wished for a return to the old order in England
looked to Mary’s influence to bring it about. She was in
some miraculous way, by her very presence at court, to
exercise power over her father’s indomitable will (the will
that had crushed her into submission), to reconcile him with
the Pope, and undo all the mischief he had been doing for
the last ten years.</p>

<p>“It is to be hoped,” wrote Chapuys to the Empress
Isabella, “that through the Princess’s means, and through
her great wisdom and discretion she may hereafter little by
little bring back the King, her father, and the whole of the
English nation to the right path. It would indeed have been
a great pity to lose such a gem, her virtues being of such a
standard, that I know not how to express and define her
great accomplishments, her wisdom, beauty, prudence, virtue,
austere life, and her other great qualities, for certainly all
those who have been and are acquainted with her, cannot
cease from praising her any more than I can.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197"
id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>He was indefatigable in promoting Mary’s interests in
every possible way. On being presented to Queen Jane, he
seems to have thought of nothing else, regarding her merely
as a useful friend, who had it in her power to smooth the
Princess’s paths. His account of the interview is interesting:—</p>

<p>“Mass over, I accompanied the King to the apartments of
the Queen, whom, with the King’s pleasure, I kissed, congratulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
her on her marriage, and wishing her prosperity.
I told her besides, that although the device of the lady
who had preceded her on the throne was ‘The happiest of
women,’ I had no doubt she herself would fully realise that
motto....</p>

<p>“Among the many felicities which I enumerated, I said to
the Queen, that certainly the chief one was the Princess, in
whom, without having had the pain and trouble of bringing her
into the world, she had such a daughter, that she would receive
more pleasure and consolation from her, than from any other
she might have. I ended by begging her to take care of the
Princess’s affairs; which she kindly promised to do, saying
that she would work in earnest to deserve the honourable
name which I had given her of pacificator, that is preserver
and guardian of the peace. After this address of mine, the
King, who had been talking with the ladies of the Court,
approached us, and began making excuses for the Queen,
saying that I was the first ambassador to whom she had spoken;
she was not used to that sort of reception, but he imagined
that she would do her utmost to obtain the title of pacificator
which I had greeted her with, as being herself of kind and
amiable disposition, and much inclined to peace, she would
make the greatest efforts to prevent his taking part in a
foreign war, were it for no other thing than the fear of having
to separate herself from him.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198"
id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>A charming trait in Mary’s character was the protection
which the now happier sister pityingly extended to Anne
Boleyn’s unfortunate daughter. For the next three years,
they continued to live chiefly at Hunsdon, under the same
roof, but while Mary was treated with a certain amount of
consideration, Elizabeth was wholly neglected, disgraced, and
unprovided with the commonest necessaries of life, at one
time having “neither gown nor kirtle, nor petticoat, nor linen
for smocks, nor kerchiefs, rails, body-stychets, handkerchiefs,
mufflers nor begens”.<a name="FNanchor_199_199"
id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
But Mary’s relations with her father,
although cordial on the whole, were lacking in every element
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of stability. All depended on his caprice, as the Princess
well knew, and had she been worldly minded, she might have
hesitated to take up the cause of one, to whom he was now
far less favourably inclined than to herself. But Mary was
not worldly, and she took care to say a good word for the
child when she could. Thus at the end of a letter to her father
she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“My sister Elizabeth is in good health, thanks be
to our Lord, and such a child toward, as I doubt not but your
highness shall have cause to rejoyce of, in time coming, as
knoweth Almighty God, who send your Grace, with the Queen
my good Mother, health with the accomplishment of your desires.</p>

<p>“From Hownsdon, the 21 day of July (1536).</p>

<p>“Your Hignes most humble daughter handmaid, and
faithfull subject,</p>

<p class="ar">
“<span class="smcap">Marye</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200"
id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>Privy Purse Expenses of the Princess Mary</i> abound in
entries for presents “to the Lady Elizabeth’s grace,” and in
the notification of sums expended on her amusements.</p>

<p>The art with which Mary received gifts was no less happy
than her manner of giving, and the letter of thanks which she
wrote to Cromwell, just after he had been made Lord Privy Seal,
in acknowledgment of his services to her, is a pleasant contrast,
in its spontaneous expressions of gratitude, to the former grovelling
effusions, which purported to have emanated from her,
but which were really the compositions of Cromwell himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“In my heartiest manner I commend me unto you,
as she which cannot express in writing the great joy and
comfort that I have received as well by your letters as by the
report of my servant this bearer, concerning the King my
Sovereign father’s goodness towards me; which I doubt not
but I have obtained much the better by your continual suit
and means. Wherefore I think myself bound to pray for
you during my life; and that I both do and will continue with
the Grace of God. Sir, as touching mine apparel, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
made no bill. For the King’s Highnes favour is so good
cloathing unto me, that I can desire no more; and so have
written to his Grace, resting wholly in him, and willing to
wear whatever his Grace shall appoint me. My Lord, I do
thank you with all my heart for the horse that you sent me
with this bearer. Wherein you have done me a great pleasure.
For I had never a one to ride upon sometimes for my health, and
besides that my servant sheweth me that he is such a one, that
I may of good right accept not only the mind of the giver, but
also the gift. And thus I commit you to God, whom I do and
shall daily pray to be with you in all your business, and to
reward you for so exceeding great pains and labours that you
take in my sutes.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201"

<p>And again:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“After my most hearty commendations, I think the
time so long since I heard from the King’s Highness, my most
benign father, that nature moveth me to be so bold as to
send my servant this bearer with letters to his Grace, and
also to the Queen, because I would very fain know how their
Graces do, desiring you, my Lord, if for lack of witt I have
sent sooner than I should have done, molesting his Grace
with my rude letters, you will make such an excuse for me
as your wisdom shall think best. For till it may please his
Highness to license me to come into his presence which of
all worldly things is my chiefest desire, my next comfort
is, to hear often of his Grace’s health and prosperous estate;
which I beseech our Lord long to preserve. My lord, your
servant hath brought me the well-favoured horse that you
have given me, with a very goodly saddle; for the which
I do thank you with all my heart. For he seemeth to be,
indeed as good as I have heard report of him, which was
that he had all the qualities belonging to a good horse.
Wherefore I trust in time to come, the riding upon him shall
do me very much good concerning my health. For I am
wont to find great ease in riding.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary’s appearance at court was still delayed, probably on
account of the difficulty with regard to her rank. If the
King’s eldest daughter was thenceforth to be regarded as
heiress apparent, she must appear as Princess of Wales, with
pomp and circumstance, but all was as yet uncertain, and for
the same reason, Henry came to no conclusion, respecting the
various marriages again proposed for her. If he had no son,
he would be unwilling for her to leave the kingdom, but in
any case hers was a name to intrigue with. “He feels,” wrote
Chapuys to the Emperor, “that he is getting old, and has no
male children to succeed him on the throne, and knows that
he will have enough to do to keep the peace in his own kingdom,
where the novelties he has introduced are not generally
approved of. He therefore thinks of nothing else save making
of good cheer, and filling his coffers with the feathers of those
whom he wishes to put down. All his late shifting and dissimulation
have no other origin, than the fear he has of your
Majesty’s affairs becoming prosperous again, and your coming
over to England to chastise him.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203"
id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>But unpopular as Henry was, Cromwell was looked upon
as the evil genius of the throne. It was he who had inspired
the divorce of Katharine, the disinheriting of Mary, the
suppression of the monasteries, the execution of those who
denied the royal supremacy, and the introduction of such
heretics as Cranmer and Latimer into the sees of Canterbury
and Worcester. In the south, the general discontent was
paralysed by dread, but the hardy, frugally living people
of the eastern and northern counties knew no fear. The
dissolution of the smaller monasteries was the signal for
revolt. The Canons of Hexham fortified their house. One
of their number appeared in armour on the leads, and declared
to the King’s Commissioners, that the twenty inmates would
all die before they would yield, and the Commissioners
thought it prudent to withdraw. But the Lincolnshire men
rose first. The rebels in the east numbered at the outset
from forty to fifty thousand men, and their ranks swelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
daily. They would undoubtedly have carried all before
them, had not the leaders of the King’s army been as prompt
as they were efficient. The Duke of Suffolk swept up from
the south, the Earl of Shrewsbury from the west, and the
King himself would have headed a third contingent, had it
been necessary. But no sooner were Lincolnshire, Norfolk
and Suffolk subdued, than Yorkshire, Lancashire and all the
northern counties were up in arms. Soon, Skipton Castle,
held by the Earl of Cumberland for the King, was the only
spot north of the Humber that Henry could count upon.
If the rebels had triumphed, there is no doubt that Mary
would have been placed on the throne.<a name="FNanchor_204_204"
id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>A statute had been passed on the 8th July 1536, declaring
Elizabeth base-born,<a name="FNanchor_205_205"
id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
and on Sunday, 30th August,
Mary was proclaimed heiress-apparent in one of the London
churches. When the Yorkshire men rose, on the 9th
October, they swore to be true “to the King’s lawful issue
and the noble blood”. Robert Aske, leader of the insurgents,
was declared Grand Captain of the Commons of Yorkshire.
He could rely on the staunch loyalty of 30,000 “tall men
and well horsed,” as well as on the enthusiastic adherence of
the whole population, while the King’s forces, under the Duke
of Norfolk, only amounted to 6,000 men, hampered in their
every movement northwards by the disaffection of the midland
and eastern counties. Had all these advantages been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
husbanded by the rebels, they might have dictated terms
to Henry; but the strongest arm is powerless against a subtle
brain, and Cromwell soon perceived that his one chance
lay in negotiation. The word meant with him stratagem
and fraud. The promise of a free pardon, and a Parliament
at York was so worded, that it was understood by all the
leaders of the rising to mean consent to their demands.
They disbanded their troops, and by degrees order was
restored. Then, all the northern towns were strongly garrisoned
by the King, and the last palpitating throes of the
rebellion were eagerly seized upon as a pretext for withdrawing
every concession that had been made. The Lords
Dacre and Hussey were arrested and sent to the block.
The Earl of Northumberland and Sir Robert Constable,
with the Abbots of Barlings, of Fountains and of Jervaulx,
were hanged in chains. Lady Bulmer, for encouraging the
rebels, was burned at the stake. A letter from Henry to
his lieutenant in the north gave him <i>carte blanche</i> for every
atrocity. The King wrote:—</p>

<p>“We approve of your proceeding in the displaying of your
banner, which, being now spread, till it is closed again, the
course of our laws must give place to martial law; and before
you close it up again, you must cause such dreadful execution
upon a good number of the inhabitants, hanging them on
trees, quartering them and setting their heads and quarters in
every town, as shall be a fearful warning, whereby shall ensue
the preservation of a great multitude.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206"
id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>It is noticeable that the King does not here speak of the
execution of the leaders, but of “a good number of the inhabitants,”
an order which resulted in the most fearful carnage.
The Duke of Norfolk, anxious to prove his loyalty, declared
that his only regret was that there were not enough iron chains
in the country in which to hang the prisoners; ropes must
serve for some. But he flattered himself that so great a
number put to death at one time had never yet been heard
of.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207"
class="fnanchor">[207]</a> “It was,” says one writer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
“as if the earth had broken out
into gibbets, but in spite of them the people, though coerced,
were not cowed.”</p>

<p>Lord Dacre, speaking before the Council, had a tongue as
free as when he led his Yorkshire yokels to battle. “It is
thou,” he said boldly, confronting Cromwell, “that art the
very special and chief cause of all this rebellion and wickedness,
and dost daily travail to bring us to our ends and strike
off our heads. I trust that ere thou diest, though thou wouldst
procure all the noblest heads within the realm to be stricken
off, yet there shall one head remain that shall strike off thy
head.” After the pardon at Doncaster, three hundred persons
wished to pull the curate out of the pulpit at Kendal Church,
crying out: “He shall proclaim the Pope to be supreme head
of the Church, or be cast into the water!”<a name="FNanchor_208_208"
id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>But in spite of the anxieties caused by the rebellion, the
perennial subject of the disposal of Mary’s hand in marriage
was occupying public attention both at home and abroad.
It kept the possibility of an alliance with Henry perpetually
before the arbiters of European affairs, and did more to avert
war than all his other tactics. But it is clear, with the whole
history of his negotiations before us, that he never intended
Mary to leave the country, and risk her repudiation of all
that he had been at so great pains to wring from her.</p>

<p>Already, in February 1536, the Emperor had devised a
marriage between his cousin Mary, and Don Loys, brother
of King Emanuel of Portugal, his brother-in-law. Henry
appeared to look favourably on the proposed match, and in
June, a formal demand was made for her hand. The matter
was allowed to drag on indefinitely; raised from time to time
with much affectation of seriousness, to suit Henry’s policy, it
was again repeatedly dropped, for the nice adjustment of the
scale, when Francis became restive, at the apparent understanding
between his ally and his enemy. Then the proposed
union of the Princess Mary with the Duke of Orleans was
once more brought forward, and so the changes rang for some
time. But all this was merely on the surface; and the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of Mary’s legitimacy was the only real point at issue, for it
involved the whole series of events which had landed Henry
in his actual position with regard to his own subjects, to his
fellow-sovereigns, and to the Pope, still a power to be reckoned
with. To yield that point was to give up all he had been
fighting for during the last ten years, and to cut away the
ground from under his feet. If he temporised long enough,
the possible birth of a son might allow him to restore his
daughter without loss of his own dignity.</p>

<p>Charles V., in putting forward Don Loys as a suitor, made
the condition, that the slur cast by Henry on Mary’s birth
should be removed; and Henry’s instructions to his special
envoy, Sir Thomas Wyatt, on the renewal of his amity with
the Emperor, show the use her father intended to make of her
renunciation of her birthright.</p>

<p>“If,” the instructions ran, “the Emperor is grieved that
the lady Mary is declared illegitimate, although born <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in
bona fide parentum</span></i>, Wyatt must declare that when the prohibition
is of the law of God, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fides</span></i> cannot be alleged;
moreover, that the assertion of her illegitimacy will irritate
the King, and Wyatt shall deliver a letter to the Emperor
from the lady Mary <i>showing how she reputes herself</i>. If the
Emperor speaks of an overture of marriage that was lately
made for her with the Infant of Portugal, he shall say he has
no commission therein, but thinks the matter might be arranged,
if the Infant will take her, as only to succeed to the
Crown in default of issue male or female from his present
queen.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209"
class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>Chapuys’ letter to the Emperor on the 7th October proves
that her difficulties were not yet at an end:—</p>

<p>“I have just this moment received a letter from the
Princess, saying that yesterday, the King her father sent her
the draft of a letter which he wished her to write to your
Majesty, the substance of which is, that being now better informed
than she was before, through reading books and continually
consulting learned and holy persons, perhaps also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
inspired by the grace of the Holy Ghost, she has of her own
free will, without compulsion of any sort, suggestion, impression,
respect or regard for any person whomsoever, acknowledged,
confirmed, and approved the statutes of this kingdom,
declaring her mother’s marriage to have been unlawful, and
the King her father to be the chief of the Church, at the same
time, begging and entreating your Majesty to allow truth to
prevail, and not disturb nor impede it at the General Council
or anywhere else—all this, in order that the King, who has behaved
so kindly towards the Princess, may not have occasion
to treat her differently. The Princess desires me to inform your
Majesty of this, and wishes to know what answer she is to
give to her father’s request. She would also be glad for your
Majesty to show discontent at her and her acts. Though it
seems to me, that this is not the time nor the opportunity for
doing so, I could not do otherwise than obey the Princess,
and express her wishes in that particular. It might be that
your Majesty could find hereafter some excuse for dissembling,
not meddling in the affair, but giving some evasive
answer or other; for although this King may insist upon the
letter being written, perhaps he may not send it on, and will
keep it by him, to use at the proper time and place. This has
been the cause of my reporting, as fully as I have done, on the
contents of the draft which the Princess has in her possession,
I have taken care to inform Count Cifuentes of everything,
even of the protest which she has already signed, as well as of
that which she ought to make, before the letter demanded of
her is written, that the Count may speak (to the Pope) and
answer as the case requires.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210"
id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>The next day, he wrote again to Cifuentes, saying that it
would be necessary to warn his Holiness of all that was going on,
that he might not, in the event of the said letter being written,
or of a similar one being shown to him, reply to the Princess as if
he were angry for what had been done. “As these people have
their doubts, as to the precise wording of the Princess’s renunciation,
and have their fears and suspicions concerning the future,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
they are now taking their measures, and trying to make sure
of her before they bring her back to court. Should she come,
I will do my best to find out a remedy in all this business;
for the present nothing more can be done. Her Highness
must be advised and encouraged to listen to the words of
these people, and not let them imagine that under what her
Highness is now doing there lies a danger for them. If your
Lordship does not know it already, I can tell you that for a
long time back, her Highness has, by my advice, applied such
a remedy, and drawn such protests for the safeguarding of her
right, that I do not think any more are required. To the protest
formerly made, the Princess herself has since added, after
consulting over the matter with me, certain clauses and words
which render all other precautions perfectly useless. Your
Lordship however must keep profoundly secret in these
matters, for should these people hear of our precautionary
measures for the future, the Princess would not be allowed
to live long. It is therefore necessary that no living person
should know of this save your Lordship, to whom I cannot at
present sufficiently declare the precise text of the letters which
her Highness, as aforesaid, will be compelled to write. You
may however be sure of one thing, namely, that those who
have the charge of making the draft thereof will forget no
circumstance nor expression likely to serve their purpose, and
will make the Princess sign it. The Princess herself being
apprehensive of what may come out of all this, has sent me
orders to communicate with his Imperial Majesty, and with
your most illustrious Lordship on the subject, that you may
be warned, and prepared to answer whenever the thing be
made public; but above all, let it be settled, that whatever
papers and letters her Highness is made to sign on this occasion,
there is no truth whatever in them, and that she signs
them by sheer force.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211"
id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>The drafts above alluded to consisted of two letters, one
addressed to the Pope, the other to the Queen of Hungary.
The contents were practically a repetition of the declarations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
which Cromwell drew up for Mary to transcribe six months
before. The expressions used were of course less abject than
those which purported to be addressed by her to her father,
but the renunciation was the same. The conclusion of the
letter addressed to the Pope was to the effect that he should
no longer trouble himself with the affairs of England, since
the King had really and truly the right on his side, and reasons
of his own to act as he did. Of her own free consent, she had
renounced the succession, and begged that neither in the future
Council nor out of it, the subject might be mentioned, or anything
done contrary to the wishes of the King of England, or
for the sake of the King of Portugal, because such was her
resolution, and she was much pleased with it.</p>

<p>Chapuys, we have seen, was quite convinced that nothing
remained for Mary but to sign the drafts. Her justification
would, as before, be the compulsion exercised, and her written
protests would, he considered, be sufficient proof that she had
not been a free agent. Nevertheless, he was anxious that the
Pope should be told of the thraldom in which she had signed,
and should declare her guiltless of all participation in the sin.
His anxiety was probably the reflex of her own, and his
personal regard for her made him wish to soothe, as far as he
was able, her much-tried conscience. Since she had acted by
his advice in the tangled skein of diplomacy in which she was
caught, his chivalry and affection prompted him to obtain for
her all the relief he could. He wrote to the Emperor on the
subject, and Charles referred the matter to his ambassador in
Rome. Cifuentes had no personal acquaintance with Mary,
and viewed the subject in the mere light of politics. He
told the Emperor in a ciphered despatch, that it would be
useless, and even dangerous to apply for a papal brief, absolving
the Princess from her oath, as, in his opinion, the imperial
ambassador in England had not shown sufficient cause why
the publication of the Princess’s justification to the world
should be delayed; for should his Holiness come to know
what the Princess had done, the French would sooner or later
hear of it; and, if so, the King of England be immediately
informed of the fact, and therefore the danger to her life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
would be increased twofold. The above were the reasons
which he (Cifuentes) had for not applying for a delay; but
since Chapuys still insisted upon it, after mature deliberation
the following expedient had been thought of: The Pope
should be petitioned for a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vivæ voces oraculo
in genere</span></i>, tacitly
including Mary, and empowering all confessors to absolve
those who might have fallen into these “new English errors”.
“In that class the Princess would necessarily be comprised,
and therefore any public justification on her own part might
be delayed for some time.” Cifuentes goes on to say that
Chapuys should remit the whole matter to him, surrounded
as he is by those whom he can trust, and who cannot fail to
help him by their wisdom and learning. If he should then
find just and honest causes why the Princess should be absolved
by her confessor, well and good. In this way, his Holiness
would be entirely ignorant of the precise and particular object
for which his verbal declaration was needed.<a name="FNanchor_212_212"
id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Mary signed the letters, and the Pope apparently gave
the dispensation asked for, without knowing who was especially
to be benefited by it, and we hear no more of the matter.</p>

<p>In the midst of these wretched diplomatic transactions
occurs the first note of joy that has greeted Mary for years,
more completely reconciling her to her father than all the
horrible concessions wrung from her by threats and entreaties.
The Queen gave promise of an heir, and Mary was
sent for to the court. The following curious extract from a
contemporary document describes the meeting between her
and the King and Queen. It is, unfortunately, undated, but
bears intrinsic evidence that it refers to the spring of 1537:—</p>

<p>“Thus the good Lady Mary’s grace lived a long time in
disgrace of the King her father, in hard imprisonment, and
danger of her life, till at the lenght, Ann Bullen being dead,
and the King maried againe unto Queen Jane, Edward’s mother
by whose meanes she came againe in favour with the King—as
thus: Upon a time as the King and the Queene were together,
she being great with child with King Edward, the King said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
unto her—Why, darling, how happeneth it you are no
merier. She wisely answered, Now it hath pleased your
grace to make me your wife, there are none but my inferiors
to make mery withall, your grace excepted, unlesse it would
please you that wee might enjoye the company of the Lady
Marie’s grace at the Court; I could be mery with her. We
will have her here, darling, if she will make the merry. So
presently the King commanded all her women to be put to
her againe, and all in rich array with his daughter, the Lady
Mary, in most gorgeous apparel, to come the next day unto the
Court, all apparelled at the King’s charge. The King and the
Queene standing in the chamber of presence by the fier. This
worthy lady entered with all her train. So soon as she came
within the chamber doore, she made lowe curtsey unto him;
in the midst of the chamber she did so againe, and when she
came to him, she made them both lowe cursey, and falling
on her knees asked his blessing, who after he had given her
his blessing, took her up by the hand, and kist her, and the
Queen also, both bidding her welcome. Then the King
turning him to the Lords there in presence, said—Some of
you weare desirous that I should put this jewell to death.
That had been great pittie, quoth the Queene, to have lost
your chefest jewell of England.... But Mary, knowing
that when her father flattered, most mischief was like to ensue,
her coler going and coming, at last in a swoone fell down
amongst them. With that the King being greatly perplexed,
what for the fear of his daughter, and the frighting of his
wife that was then great with child, sought all meanes
possible to recover her, and being come to herself, bid her be
a good comfort, for nothing should goe against her, and after
perfect recovery, took her by the hand, and walked up and
down with her. Then commandment was made that she
should be called Lady Princess, and the other Lady Elizabeth.
Why, governor, quoth the Lady Elizabeth, being but
a child, how happs it yesterday, Lady Princess and to-day but
Lady Elizabeth? Here was a haughtie stomach betimes.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213"
id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<p>The account is inaccurate in two points. Henry never
gave in on the question of Mary’s title. Princess in those
days meant heiress to the Crown, and he would have been
less likely than ever to give it back to his daughter, when the
passionately longed-for son might shortly be granted to him.
Moreover, Elizabeth had been deprived of the title by act of
Parliament months before, and would not have remained in
ignorance of the fact till Mary’s return to court, as it had
nothing whatever to do with her sister, in the actual state
of affairs, but with the declared nullity of Anne Boleyn’s
marriage.</p>

<p>On the 23rd May, arrived Hurtado de Mendoza, special
envoy from Charles V., to confer with Chapuys, and learn
from him his latest news of the King’s will, regarding the
Portuguese match. He remained in England for more than a
year, and during that time, the wearisome negotiations went
on, with the utmost insistence as to detail, while Henry was
probably determined from the outset that they should come
to nothing. He declared bluntly his refusal to legitimatise
Mary, but held out hopes that she would be heiress to the
throne, should he die without legitimate issue. When the
Emperor had first suggested the marriage, the King of
Portugal was disinclined to it, saying that no confidence
could be placed in Henry, but Charles had set his mind upon
it, and wrote to his ambassador in England, that if it appeared
that the Princess would be forced into some other union (he
feared with Cromwell) they were to see whether it would be
possible to carry her out of the country. Henry told Gardiner
to answer any inquiries about the Lady Mary’s marriage with
Don Loys, that it was “neither agreed upon nor in any towardness”.
Further, in his instructions to Sir Thomas Wyatt,
whom he was sending as envoy to Charles, he told him that
if the Emperor marvelled, that there was no furtherance in
the matter, he should reply that Mendoza brought no commission
for it, and came so slenderly despatched that the
default is not since supplied, and thinks the matter scarcely
in earnest.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214"
class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>
<p>All these excuses were made to gain time. If a prince
were born and lived, there would be less danger in sending
Mary abroad, but among so many aspirants to her hand,
Henry was resolved only to part with her to the highest
bidder, if, indeed, he parted with her at all. The match with
the Duke of Orleans was perhaps the most to his liking, but
Francis demanded that she should be declared legitimate,
and that was the only thing Henry was quite resolved not to
do. If he had no son, all foreign princes would agree, in
spite of him, in looking upon her as his rightful heir, and in
view of such a contingency he could not afford to let her go
out of the kingdom. His difficulties were so far understood
on the continent, as to create a general apprehension that he
would marry her to Cromwell.</p>

<p>In the midst of the universal tension, the Queen was
brought to bed on the 12th October, vigil of Edward the
Confessor. But so slowly did even great news travel in those
days, that on the 17th, in many parts of the country, the
people were still praying for a prince, while in others, vague
rumours were beginning to circulate to the effect that they had
one. The circumstance was not known in Brussels till the
20th, when the Emperor expressed his satisfaction, and said
he thought that his cousin Mary was delivered of a great
burden.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215"
class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>At the christening of Prince Edward, “the most dearest
son of King Henry,” Mary was the most prominent figure as
godmother. She walked next to the canopy, under which
the royal infant was carried, her train being borne by Lady
Kingston. Then the chrism (for the Prince’s confirmation)
”richly garnished was borne by the Lady Elizabeth, the
King’s daughter, the same lady for her tender age being borne
by the Viscount Beauchamp, with the assistance of the Lord
Morley”. On the return of the procession from the church,
Elizabeth walked by the side of Mary, who held her hand,
and the Prince “was taken to the King and Queen, and had
the blessing of God, our Lady and St. George, and of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
father and mother”. A <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</span></i> was sung in St. Paul’s
and in other churches of the city, and great fires were made in
every street. There was much “goodly banqueting, shooting
of guns all day and night, and great gifts were distributed”.</p>

<p>The nation’s joy, which was undoubtedly deep and sincere,
can hardly be said to have turned into mourning, when the
news was spread that the good Queen had received the Sacraments
of Penance and Extreme Unction, and was dying. It
was not merely that the people had not had time to become
attached to her, but the sixteenth century set no great value
on human life in general, and that of a queen consort was held
exceptionally cheap in England. It was a time when there
might indeed be indignation for wrongs, and tears for a friend’s
misfortune; but little grief was felt for bodily sufferings or
death. Deeply as Katharine of Arragon was beloved by
English men and women, and loudly as they expressed their
sense of the injuries inflicted on her, her death would perhaps
have caused little emotion, had it not been accompanied by
suspicious circumstances. When Anne Boleyn went to her
doom, even her friends were indifferent, although the obvious
unfairness of her trial aroused pity and abhorrence. The
Duke of Richmond’s funeral passed almost unnoticed; and
if the executions after the Northern Rising sent a thrill of
horror through the country, this was produced by butcheries
such as had never before been known. That which was
natural and inevitable excited little notice, and Gardiner
was not more wanting in sensibility than the rest of his
contemporaries, when he crudely charged the envoys to announce
to the King of France, that “though the Prince is
well, and sucketh like a child of his puissance, the Queen,
by the neglect of those about her, who suffered her to take
cold, and eat such things as her fantasy in sickness called
for, is dead”.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216"
class="fnanchor">[216]</a> He went on to say that “the King though he
takes this chance reasonably, is little disposed to marry again,
but some of his Council have thought it meet to urge him to
it, for the sake of his realm, and he has framed his mind both to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
be indifferent to the thing, and to the election of any person
from any part that with deliberation shall be thought meet”.</p>

<p>Queen Jane died on the 24th October, and in a letter to
Lord Lisle on the 3rd November Sir John Wallop says:
“The King is in good health, and merry as a widower may
be, the Prince also”.<a name="FNanchor_217_217"
id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>By command of the Duke of Norfolk, twelve hundred
Masses were ordered to be said for the repose of the Queen’s
soul, and a solemn Dirge and Requiem were sung at St.
Paul’s. Jane had died at Hampton Court, but was buried at
Windsor, on the 12th November, Mary being chief mourner at
her funeral, following the hearse on horseback at a foot’s pace.
Her palfrey was in black velvet trappings and her train was
held up by eight ladies of the highest rank.</p>

The depositions of the malcontents often contained expressions to the effect
that the country was “ruled by knaves,” and that the people thought “the Lady
Mary would have a title to the Crown one day”. In the course of the examination
of the ringleaders, in the Tower, after the rebellion, one of them said,
“The Lady Mary ought to be favoured for her great virtues, and the statute
annulled ... that she should not be made illegitimate except by the law of
the whole Church, for she is marvellously beloved by the whole people”
(Examination of Aske, Record Office).</p></div>

The reason given was the affinity between her mother and the King’s
former mistress, Anne Boleyn’s sister. “Le statut declairant princesse légitime
héritiere la fille de la concubine a este revoque, et elle [mesme] declairee bastarde,
non point comme fille de maistre Norris, comme se pouvait plus honnestement
dire, mais pour avoir avant este le mariage entre la dite concubine et le dit roy
illégitime a cause qu’il avait cognu charnellement la sœur de la dite concubine”

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> was now the most prominent princess in Europe. The
character, the accomplishments, the personal charms of none
were so amply discussed, so widely known, so universally
admired. Her beauty is spoken of in terms which to modern
ears sound extravagant. There was scarcely a marriageable
representative of any royal house, who did not aspire to her
hand, for strange as it seems, there is no sign that her
political value was diminished by the birth of an heir to the
throne. If Henry would but have consented to declare her
legitimate, Francis I. would have entered eagerly into a
fresh negotiation for her marriage with the Duke of Orleans,
the question of which was being constantly renewed during
the next few years.<a name="FNanchor_218_218"
id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
Sir William Paget, the English ambassador
in France, did his best to promote the match in
1542, and Henry would have been far more likely to make
concessions to please Francis, than for any other consideration,
but to give in on that point would have been to stultify
all that he had done. The Emperor’s candidate had less
chance still. He had never been a <i>persona grata</i> at the
English court, and however anxious Henry was to avoid war,
he was far from contemplating a close alliance with Charles.
There remained the German Protestant princes, the Emperor’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
enemies, and they admirably suited Henry’s purpose
of hampering Charles in every possible way; but when this
policy threatened to push him into the arms of France,
Henry abandoned the Lutherans, greatly to Cromwell’s disgust,
and suggested that Charles, then a widower, should take
Mary, and his son Philip, her sister Elizabeth. The proposal
was sufficient to save the situation, without committing him
to anything definite, knowing as he did full well, that it would
be met by a demand for Mary’s rehabilitation, without which
no step in the direction of such a marriage would be taken.</p>

<p>It is easy to form a notion of Mary’s personal appearance
during these years, for besides the portraits painted by
Holbein, who generally aimed at faithful likenesses, remarks
on her face and form are sandwiched into most of the longer
despatches of the ambassadors of all the principal powers
of Europe. Marillac, the French envoy, wrote more soberly
than most of them, for he was not much inclined to a closer
friendship between his master and a renegade of Henry’s
kidney, the excesses “of this King” being a theme on which
he and his colleagues dwelt freely. He describes Mary as
”twenty-four years of age, of medium height, with well-proportioned
features, and a perfect complexion, which makes her
look as if she were but eighteen. Her voice is full and deep,
and rather more masculine in tone than her father’s. Some
praise her musical talents, others her proficiency in languages,
others her dancing; all feel the charm of her goodness and
benignity, and the pure atmosphere that surrounds her, in
marvellous contrast to the tainted air of the court.”<a name="FNanchor_219_219"
id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>The author of <i>The Life of Jane Dormer, Duchess of Feria</i>
observes, in the stiff phraseology of the time, that when she
grew older she was commended “to the most noble and
Catholic princess, the lady Mary, so persuaded by her grandfather
Sidney, whom two of his daughters had served before,
and died in her service much favoured of her Highness for their
virtue. When the queens (the wives of King Henry) had
sought with much importunity to have them in their service,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
they would by no means leave the lady Mary, although the
King himself requested it. In those days the house of this
princess was the only harbour for honourable young gentlewomen
given any way to piety and devotion. It was the true
school of virtuous demeanour, befitting the education that ought
to be in noble damsels, and the greatest lords of the kingdom
were suitors to her to receive their daughters in her service.“<a name="FNanchor_220_220"
id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>It was perhaps mainly on account of the esteem in which
she was held, at home and abroad, that Mary was the object
of so jealous a supervision on the part of Henry’s Council.
The parents and guardians of the many “<i>noble damsels</i>” who
desired an asylum in her house were peremptorily informed
that she might have no more than the prescribed number;
and occasionally one or two would be dismissed in the
most arbitrary manner, no reason being given. Her every
movement was watched with suspicion, and even when
she was supposed to be enjoying her father’s favour, she was
continually on the verge of losing it, for the most innocent
causes. She could not exercise the least hospitality without
being subjected to annoyance, and in May 1538, the fact of
her having entertained guests, whom she allowed to sleep
under her roof, was made a matter of accusation to the
Council. Her reply to Cromwell’s remonstrance and warning
is significant of the bondage in which she was held.</p>

<p>Henry and Cromwell were both anxious to detach her
from the Emperor, and they tried to do so by creating a
misunderstanding between them, telling Mary that he had
been wanting in zeal to promote her marriage. Hurtado de
Mendoza was still in England, and Cromwell wrote to inform
her that the ambassador extraordinary would pay her a
visit with Chapuys, at the same time advising her to complain
to them of the Emperor’s coldness on the subject of Don
Loys’s suit. But Mary was not for an instant misled as to
Cromwell’s intention, and her answer to his letter shows that
she was learning how to deal with his unscrupulous policy.
On the 24th August 1538, she wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

pleasure, touching my communication to the emperor’s ambassadors,
when they shall come to visit the prince’s grace,
my brother; which thing (although his grace’s pleasure
except) I would have been very loath to have spoken
of, considering myself a young maid, and very willing to
continue that life, if his said majesty will permit the same;
nevertheless, according to my duty, I shall fulfil all things
contained in your letters, as well as my simple wit will serve
me; and also write their whole answer unto you as soon as
they shall depart. In the meanwhile, not forgetting the
inestimable goodness of the King’s majesty towards me, in

<p>She then at once communicated Cromwell’s letter to
the envoys, in order that they might be prepared with an
answer, when they came to see her. Chapuys, on behalf
of both, thus described the whole matter to the Emperor, six
days later:—</p>

<p>“The King granted us permission to visit the Prince and
the Princess, though we perceived that had we not applied for
such permission, he himself would have requested us to go,
for he evidently wished the latter to speak to us, as prescribed
in a letter of Sir Cromwell, addressed to her in his (the King’s)
name. The substance of the letter was that she (the Princess)
had heard from an authentic quarter, the dissimulation employed
by us, your Majesty’s ambassadors, in the discussion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of the affair concerning her individually, and that from the
fact of your Majesty being her good lord and cousin, all
people would have thought that your kindness and friendship
towards her would have been of greater magnitude. Being
a woman, she could not help saying so much to us; not
indeed that she felt any particular desire or anxiety for the
issue of the matter in question (since she only obeyed in that
respect the commands of her most gracious and loving father
the King, in whom, after God, she placed all her trust) but
because after so many overtures and fine words, nothing had
been concluded, as she heard; and also because when merchants
were in the habit of bestowing as a dower on their
daughters, one fourth of their annual revenue in cash, we
Imperial ministers should only have offered 20,000 ducats,
and even those so uncertain as to the manner of settlement,
that had misfortune obliged her to leave England, and have
recourse to her dower, she might perhaps never have known
upon what her revenue was settled. Sir Cromwell, as it appears,
had besides, written to her to use the very words of the
letter, coupled with such gentle terms as her own wisdom and
natural discretion might suggest, and immediately inform him
of what passed at the interview with us. We must observe
that the contents of Sir Cromwell’s letter to the Princess had
been duly communicated by her to us, the day before we
called, that we might be prepared to shape our answer in
writing; which we did accordingly, that she herself might
transmit it to her father the King.</p>

<p>“The answer, as we flatter ourselves, is courteous and
satisfactory for both parties. We omit it for fear of lengthening
this despatch of ours already too prolix perhaps.</p>

<p>“After visiting the Prince, who is the prettiest child we
ever set eyes upon, we returned to the Princess, and began
again, to speak about Sir Cromwell’s letter, and our own
answer to it. After a good deal of conversation on the subject,
the Princess said to us, that all her hopes centred in God, and
your Imperial Majesty, and that she held you in the room
of father and mother, and was so affectionately attached to
you, that it seemed almost impossible to her to have such an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
affection and love for a kinsman. She knew perfectly well,
that it had not been your fault, if the affair of her marriage
had remained in the state in which it is, that she really believed
what we had told her to be the exact truth, in spite
of the efforts made to persuade her to the contrary. Indeed,
she owned to us, that about last Lent, the King her father had
tried to convince her that your Imperial Majesty proceeded
in the affair with the utmost dissimulation, and without any
wish whatsoever to treat of it, so much so that it seemed as
if the whole thing had been planned, in order to bring discredit
upon him (the King). She, the Princess, had before and after
her father’s representations, experienced that the contrary was
the case, and therefore she was now ready to act one way or
the other, whichever your Imperial Majesty decided, respecting
the marriage proposal. This seemed to us a fair opportunity
to ask her, as we did, then and there, whether in case of a
favourable opportunity presenting itself, she would have courage
enough to leave England by stealth. To this question of
ours, the Princess, from modesty, as we presume, did at first
show some reluctance to reply. Then she said that she could
not say yes or no, for things might arrive at such a pitch, and
the occasion for her departure from this country might become
so propitious and favourable, that she would have no scruple
or difficulty at all in leaving. Anyhow she would let me
know her intentions on that score; for it might happen after
all, that the King her father might hereafter show greater
consideration for her, or cause her to be more respected and
better treated than she had been until now; in which case,
she would much prefer remaining in England, and conforming
herself entirely to her father’s commands and wishes, obeying
him implicitly and so forth, though still acting by my advice.
Such was the Princess’s language in the two long conferences
we held with her. In short, she begged us to present to your
Majesty her most humble commendations, until she herself
did so by letter.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223"
class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>Mary had reasons enough to dread worse treatment, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
spite of her humble expressions of submissive obedience.
After the first flush of her reconciliation and return to court,
and more especially after the death of Queen Jane, who had
always befriended her, Henry’s irritation broke out afresh.
At Easter 1538, the mourning for the Queen being over,
Lady Kingston sent to Wriothesley, Keeper of the Wardrobe
and Cromwell’s Secretary, “to know the King’s pleasure
whether my Lady Mary’s grace should leave wearing of
black this Easter or not”. She received the ungracious reply
that the Lady Mary might wear “what colour she would”.
Nothing daunted, Lady Kingston again wrote, “My Lady’s
grace desireth you now to be a suitor to the King’s grace, for
her wearing her whiten taffety edged with velvet, which used
to be to his own liking, whenever he saw her grace, and suiteth
to this joyful feast of our Lord’s holy rising from the dead”.<a name="FNanchor_224_224"
id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
There is no answer to this letter, but about the same time
there is a warrant in Cromwell’s <i>Remembrances</i>, written in
Wriothesley’s hand, “for apparell for my Lady Mary”.<a name="FNanchor_225_225"
id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>During the whole of this year, although supposed to be
in favour, Mary was not only in an uncomfortable, but in a
more or less dangerous position. She was virtually a prisoner
in her own house, and was not even allowed to take the
exercise which her health needed. Henry saw her occasionally
and dined with her at Richmond in May; but she was closely
watched, and scarcely ever permitted to appear in public,
while the sums allowed for her household expenses were
painfully inadequate.</p>

<p>On the 14th September, Mendoza wrote to Charles V., that
when he last saw her, she was in good health, but he had
heard, that she had been unwell for the last few days, and
that he thought the cause of it was to be found in the confinement
in which she lived, “for nowadays she is kept much
closer, and more poorly than before”. This new piece of
persecution had for its sole object to force her to give up
her only powerful friend, the Emperor, whose advice to her
Henry felt was continually getting in the way of his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
particular affairs. He could not apparently convince her
that Charles’s friendship was not disinterested, but at least
he could keep her a constant “suitor,” and in the humble
position of a beggar, at his own royal and sacred feet. The
letter which she wrote to Cromwell, in her urgent need for
money, was entirely after the despot’s heart.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“After my most hearty commendations to you;

never refused to further my continual suites to you, it maketh
me the bolder to use mine accustomed manner in writing
to you, to be mean for me to the King’s Highness, for such
things as I have need of, which at this time is this. It hath
pleased the King’s majestie, my most gracious father, of his
great goodness, to send me every quarter of this year, fourty
pounds, as you best know; for you were always a mean for it
as (I thank you) you be for all my other suits. And seeing
this quarter of Christmas must needs be more chargeable
than the rest, specially considering the house I am in, I would
desire you, if your wisdom thought it most convenient, to be
a suitor to the King’s said Highness (if it may so stand with
his gracious pleasure) somewhat to increase that sum. And
thus, my Lord, I am ashamed always to be a beggar to you;
but that the occasion at this time is such, that I cannot chuse.
Wherefore I trust in your goodness, you will accept it thereafter.
And thus I commit you to God, desiring him to reward
you for all your pains taken for me.</p>

</p></div>

<p>Soon after writing this letter, the whirligig of her father’s
caprice placed her again at court, and from the beginning of
the following year, she was the subject of one matrimonial
scheme after another, Henry even pretending to go so far as
to associate her with his own plans for a fourth marriage. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
January 1539 Christopher Mont or Mount, a German agent
in his service, was instructed to proceed to the court of the
Duke of Saxony, and treat with Burgartus the Duke’s Vice-chancellor
concerning a marriage, between the young Duke of
Cleves and the Lady Mary. There is an amusing difference
between Henry’s solemn, if hollow forms of negotiation with
the first-rate powers of Europe, and the polite contempt with
which he treats the petty German princes. If Burgartus desire
“the picture of her face,” and say he wrote for it, Mont is
to remind him that she is a King’s daughter, and that it was
never seen, that the pictures of persons of such degree were
sent abroad. Burgartus moreover has seen her, “and can
testify of her proportion, countenance and beauty, and though
she is only the King’s natural daughter, she is endued, as all
the world knows, with such beauty, learning and virtue, that
when the rest is agreed, no man would stick for any part
concerning her beauty and goodness”.</p>

<p>Having disposed of this matter, Cromwell, in his instructions
to Mont, goes on to say that he is diligently to inquire of the
beauty and qualities of the elder of the two daughters of the
Duke of Cleves, her shape, stature and complexion, and if
he hear she is “such as might be likened unto his Majesty,”
he shall tell Burgartus, that Cromwell, tendering the King’s
alliance in Germany, “would be glad to induce the King to
join with them, specially for the Duke of Saxony’s sake,
who is allied there, and to make a cross marriage between
the young Duke of Cleves and Lady Mary, and the King
and the elder daughter of Cleves; for as yet, he knows no
conclusion, in any of the overtures of marriage made to his
grace in France or Flanders”. But first it was expedient
that they should send her portrait. Mont is not to speak
as if demanding her, “but rather to give them a prick to offer
her”.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227"
class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Mont performed his mission zealously, and pressed the
matter, urging daily, that the portrait of the lady might be
sent to England. The Duke promised to send it, but explained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
that his painter Lucas Cranach was sick at home; and meanwhile
Mont wrote, that as for her beauty she was said “to
surpass the Duchess of Milan, as the golden sun surpassed
the silver moon”.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228"
class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The affair concerning the Lady Anne
of Cleves continued its course, and the ultimate sending of
her portrait to Henry has been duly chronicled by all writers
on his fourth marriage. But the subject of her brother’s union
with Mary was alternately dropped and revived, until it was
at length allowed to die away in silence. Both schemes were
the product of Cromwell’s ingenuity. They register the
height to which Lutheran influence in the Church of England
had risen at this period, the first decisive step towards his
downfall and the return to more Catholic doctrines.</p>

<p>It was while Lutheran doctrines were still in the ascendant
in England, and Mary’s possible bestowal on a Lutheran
prince was everywhere discussed, that the Empress Isabella
died, and immediately rumours were afloat that Charles would
marry his cousin. The French at once took alarm, and
Marillac, their ambassador in England, asked Henry what
truth there was in the report. Henry replied, that whoever
proposed such a thing must be out of his senses, although
he had himself put the suggestion before Charles. He affected
indignation, and declared that he could never trust the Emperor,
who had once broken his promise to him, and who was
always looking out for an opportunity of setting the Christian
princes one against the other, to serve his own ambition,
which was so great, that were he the sole monarch of Christendom
he would not be satisfied.<a name="FNanchor_229_229"
id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was not believed, and Melancthon complained,
that in England the pious doctrine was again oppressed
and adversaries triumphed, and that some suspected it was
owing to the deliberations for the marriage of the Emperor
with the King of England’s daughter. The French ambassador
in Rome said that the Pope was in dread, lest Charles
should ally himself with the great enemy of the Church.
Reginald Pole, then in Rome, wrote to Cardinal Contarini;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
“They say it is in treaty to give the Princess to the Emperor.
May God do what is best.” There was certainly some excuse
for these surmises in the Catholic reaction taking place in
England, a reaction however that had as little real bearing
on an alliance with the Empire as it had, according to some,
on a possible reconciliation with the Pope. Those who had
opposed the King on the subject of his first divorce, and who
still maintained the validity of his marriage with Katharine
of Arragon, were as much in danger as ever, none of his
subsequent matrimonial complications effacing the resentments
which the first had inspired. He was never less
inclined, however much he might persecute heretics, to make
up his quarrel with Rome, and Cromwell was still the powerful
enemy of the Catholic party, in spite of his having been
thwarted by the King in his championship of the German
reformers. He could still strike with the other side of his
two-edged sword, and the terror of his name was great; for
although Henry and his chief secretary were at variance on
the subject of sacraments, there was a perfect understanding
between them in the matter of the royal supremacy, and headship,
and as to the coercive measures necessary to enforce
them.</p>

<p>The principal object of their vengeance at this time was
Reginald Pole, not merely on account of the book he had written
<i>On the Unity of the Church</i>, but more especially because he had
appealed to the Emperor to execute the Bull of Deposition
fulminated by the Pope against Henry. All attempts to
lure him back to England had failed, but he was not therefore
to remain entirely unpunished. As it was not possible to
strike him directly, he must suffer through the helpless and
innocent members of his family, who were still in Henry’s
power. In default of the son, there was nothing to prevent
reprisals on the mother, and a parliamentary roll, dated 28th
April 1539, records the arrest and attainder of Margaret
Plantagenet, Countess of Salisbury, of Lord Montague her
eldest son, and of several others. The only crimes imputed to
them were their correspondence with Reginald Pole and their
having “named and promulged that venemous serpent the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Bishop of Rome to be supreme head of the Church of England”.</p>

<p>A letter from John Worth to Lord Lisle, after Lady
Salisbury’s arrest, contains a curious allusion to the old project
of betrothing the Princess Mary to her kinsman.</p>

<p>“Pleaseth your Lordship so it is that there was a coat
armour found in the Duchess of Salisbury’s coffer, and by
the one side of the coat, there was the King’s grace his arms
of England, that is the lions without the <i>fleur de lys</i>, and about
the whole arms was made pansies for Pole, and marygolds for
my Lady Mary. This was about the coat armour. And
betwixt the marygold and the pansy was made a tree to rise
in the midst, and on the tree a coat of purple hanging on a
bough, in token of the coat of Christ, and on the other side
of the coat all the Passion of Christ. Pole intended to have
married my lady Mary, and betwixt them both should again
arise the old doctrine of Christ. This was the intent that the
coat was made, as it is openly known in the Parliament house,
as Master Sir George Speke showed me. And this my lady
Marquess, my lady Salisbury, Sir Adrian Forskew [Fortescue],
Sir Thomas Dingley with divers others are attainted
to die by act of Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230"
id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Pole thus wrote of his mother’s arrest to Cardinal Contarini:—</p>

<p>“You have heard, I believe of my mother being condemned
by public council to death, or rather to eternal life. Not only
has he who condemned her, condemned to death a woman of
seventy, than whom he has no nearer relation except his
daughter, and of whom he used to say there was no holier
woman in his kingdom, but at the same time, her grandson,
son of my brother, a child, the remaining hope of our race.
See how far this tyranny has gone, which began with priests,
in whose order it only consumed the best, then [went on]
to nobles, and there too destroyed the best. At length it
has come to women and innocent children; for not only my
mother is condemned, but the wife of that marquis [of Exeter]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
who was slain with my brother, whose goodness was famous
and whose little son is to follow her. Comparing these things
with what the Turk has done in the East, there is no doubt
but that Christians can suffer worse under this western Turk.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231"
id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>In Cromwell’s <i>Remembrances</i> occurs this entry: “What
the King will have done with the Lady of Salisbury”.<a name="FNanchor_232_232"
id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> It
was his pleasure that she should languish in prison for two
years, before her grey head was brought to the scaffold, but her
son, Lord Montague, had suffered no such delay. Together
with Courtenay, Marquis of Exeter he had been arrested, the
latter for no other crime than for saying, “Knaves rule about
the King,” and that he trusted “to give them a buffet some day,”
and together they were beheaded on Tower Hill. Courtenay’s
young son Edward, mentioned in Pole’s letter, remained in the
Tower, grew up there, and was liberated by Mary in person
on her accession.</p>

<p>Chapuys describes Lady Salisbury’s execution in the
Tower, in presence of the Lord Mayor and about 150 persons.
He says that when informed of her sentence she found it very
strange, not knowing her crime; but she walked to the space
in front of the Tower where there was no scaffold, but only
a small block, and there commended her soul to God. She
desired those present to pray for the King, Queen, Prince and
Princess. The ordinary executioner being absent, a “blundering
garçonneau” performed the office, who hacked her
head and shoulders to pieces.<a name="FNanchor_233_233"
id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>There is no trace in the public records of the immediate
effect produced on Mary by these frightful occurrences, except
that Chapuys reports to the Emperor that “the Princess
has been very ill, and in some danger of her life, but thanks
to God she is beginning to recover, and there is a hope that
owing to the good diet prescribed by her physicians, and the
great care her father, and her own servants take of her, she
will soon recover completely”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>She knew by experience, how slight a remark would suffice
to place her own head in jeopardy, and acutely as she would
feel the awful fate of her best friends, especially that of one
to whom she owed next to her mother all her early training
in that “virtue and goodness” of which even her father was
proud, she dared not give utterance to the least word of
sorrow, or even show a mournful countenance lest she should
excite his wrath. When the strain became too great, the
nervous tension ended in a complete break-down that must
have been a relief. When we consider that even thoughts,
sympathies and friendships were interpreted high-treason by
this “western Turk,” and that Mary’s mental attitude was
well-known to him, her hair-breadth escapes partake of the
marvellous. In spite of her yielding to his every demand, he
knew full well that his daughter had never given an interior
consent to his new laws, and that in the eyes of Europe, he
was on account of those same laws an object of derision.
The only way in which he could claim respect for himself and
for them was by becoming a terror. There is no doubt that
Mary was still of value to him in playing off one of his allies
against another, but at any moment it might suit his policy
better to behead her, than to pretend to dispose of her in
marriage. Cromwell, it is true, seemed to be her friend, but
in the past, he had been the origin of her troubles, and it was
evident to all, that his friendship would be as chaff before the
wind, if she stood between him and the attainment of his
purpose. It has been more than once pointed out by biographers
of Cromwell, that he was not unnecessarily cruel,
that he never sent any to the block from private passion, that
he took no delight in bloodshed for its own sake. Neither
was he accessible to any feeling of generosity or pity. All
the thews and sinews of his make were of iron; humanity he
esteemed a weakness, and altogether beside his one absorbing
study of the advancement of self, by ministering to the greed,
vanity and caprice of his master. He at last came to understand
Henry’s character better than his own, and could have
foretold the doom that awaited him, if he had been able to
estimate the extent of his own capacity to satisfy the tyrant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>But for her tact and judgment, cultivated by Chapuys,
Mary must inevitably, like innumerable others, even after
her supreme sacrifice, have been crushed between these two
millstones.</p>

<p>Henry had concluded the negotiations for his marriage
with Anne of Cleves, in the autumn of 1539, and the lady
arrived in England before the end of the year. But the subject
of Mary’s union with Anne’s brother having now been dropped,
another aspirant to her hand appeared on the scene. This
was Philip, Duke of Bavaria, nephew of the Count Palatine,
whose wooing was surrounded with some little romance. The
preliminaries for this proposed marriage went farther, and
gave more promise of fulfilment than any of the various
plans for the disposal of the Princess since her childhood.
The object of Duke Philip’s visit to England was at first kept
secret, although Marillac, the shrewd ambassador of Francis
I., was not long in discovering it. “There is a talk,” he wrote
to Montmorency, “of the marriage of this King’s eldest
daughter with the young Duke of the house of Bavaria, but
there seems no appearance of it, except that he will not give
her to a powerful prince, lest he should afterwards raise some
claim to this crown.”<a name="FNanchor_234_234"
id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Wriothesley was sent to Hertford Castle,
where Mary was then residing, to announce to her this new
proposal. It does not appear whether she had any warning
of his errand, Chapuys being then absent from England, and
although her agreement to whatever marriage Henry might
decide on for her was a foregone conclusion, Wriothesley’s
account of the interview and her own answer to Cromwell are
interesting documents.</p>

<p>Wriothesley wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Pleaseth your Lordship to understand, that arriving here
at Hertford castle this afternoon about two of the clock,
upon knowledge given of my coming and desire to speak with
my Lady Mary’s Grace, I had immediately access to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
same, to whom after the delivery of the King’s Majestie’s
token, with his Grace’s most hearty commendations, I opened
the cause and purpose of my coming, in as good sort as my
poor witt had conceived the same. Whereunto she made me
answer, that albeit the matter were towards her of great importance,
and besides of such sort and nature, as the King’s
Majestie not offended, she would wish and desire never to
enter that kind of religion, but to continue still a maid during
her life: yet remembering how by the laws of God and nature
she was bound to be in this, and all other things obedient to
the King’s Highness, and how by her own bond and obligation
she had heretofore of her free will, according to her said bond
and duty, obliged herself to the same, tho she might by frailty
be induced in this so weighty a thing to cast many doubts,
and to take great stay with herself: yet wholly and entirely
without qualification, she committed herself to his Majestie,
as to her most benign and mercifull father and most gracious
Soveraign Lord; trusting and assuredly knowing, that his
goodness and wisdom would so provide in all things for her,
as should much exceed her simple capacity, and redound
to his Grace’s honour and her quiet; which thing she will
this night write with her Grace’s own hand, to be sent by me
to-morrow at my return. I assure your Lordship, here can
no more be desired, than with all humility and obedience is
offered. And because I must tarry all night for these letters,
I thought meet to signifie how farr I had proceeded, to the
intent, the King’s Majestie knowing the same, may further in
all things determine, as to his Grace’s high wisdom shall be
thought meet and expedient.</p>

<p>“When I had done with her Grace, I went then to my
Lady Elizabeth’s Grace, and to the same made the King’s
Majestie’s most hearty commendations, declaring that his
Highness desired to hear of her health, and sent her his
blessing. She gave humble thanks, enquiring again of his
Majestie’s welfare, and that with as great a gravitie as she
had been 40 years old. If she be no worse educated than
she now appeareth to me, she will prove of no less honor and
womanhood than shall beseem her father’s daughter; whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
our Lord long preserve unto us, and send your Lordship also
long life many years to serve the same.</p>

<p>“From Hartford Castle this Wednesday the seventeenth
of December.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Mary’s letter to her father on
this occasion has been lost, but to Cromwell she wrote as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>

<p>“After my most hearty commendations, I do in
semblable manner thank you for your gentle and friendly
letters. How I have proceeded, touching the counsel of the
same for the matter declared by Mr. Wriothesley, because
both by his relation and by my letters, to the King’s Majesty
you shall perceive, I shall not trouble you with my vain words
in writing: only this I will add, that howsoever I am in this
kind of thing affected, his Highness in this, and all other things
during my life shall find me his most humble and obedient
daughter, subject and servant; and so I beseech you ever to
say and answer for me. I shall not, God willing, disapprove
your saying in the same, while the breath shall be in my
body; as knows our Lord, who send you health.</p>

<p>“From Hertford Castle, the 17th of December, late at
night. I beseech your lordship to pardon me that I write
not this letter of mine own hand. I was something weary
with the writing of the other letter, and upon trust of your
goodness, I caused one of my men in this to supply the
place of a secretary.</p>

<p>

</p></div>

<p>Henry’s sole object in this negotiation appears to have
been to hoodwink the Emperor into a belief that he was
again throwing himself on the side of the German Princes,
and to secure this, he allowed matters to go further towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
a conclusion than he had ever before suffered them to go. With
a great pretence of secrecy, he took care that the French and
Imperial ambassadors should know all about the affair. Marillac
wrote on the 27th December, to say that the news he communicated
to Montmorency on the 24th was confirmed “touching
the marriage of the lady Mary with the Duke of Bavaria, who
three or four days ago, <i>as secretly as he could</i>, went to visit
her in a house of the Abbot of Westminster, in the gardens
of the Abbey, a mile from this town, whither she had been
brought. After having kissed her, which is an argument
either of marriage or of near relationship, seeing that since the
death of the late marquis, no lord of this kingdom has dared
to go so far, the said Duke had a long conversation with her,
partly in German, through an interpretator, and partly in
Latin, of which she is not ignorant. Finally, they mutually
declared, the said lord his resolution, taken with this King,
to have her for wife, ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pourveu que sa personne
luy feust agréable</span></i>,’
and the said lady her willingness to obey her father. He
cannot say when the marriage will come off, but some think
in fifteen or twenty days; others that the weddings of father
and daughter will be on the same day, that is, as soon as the
lady, who is at Calais arrives. She is only detained by the
wind, which yesterday was not contrary.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237"
id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The Duke presented his supposed fiancée with a cross of
diamonds set with four pearls, and one great pearl pendant,<a name="FNanchor_238_238"
id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
and there the matter ended for the moment. Anne of Cleves
had landed at Deal, and Henry was taken up with the subject
of his own marriage.</p>

<p>A letter in the Record Office from Henry VIII. to some
person unnamed, commands him to prepare himself “and all
other things meet and convenient, to bring unto us our entirely
beloved daughters, the ladies Mary and Elizabeth, in
such honourable sort as you can”. They were among the
foremost to receive their father’s bride, and took part in the
wedding festivities. These were however clouded by the
royal bridegroom’s disappointment on seeing the lady. Reports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of her beauty, and also of her want of beauty have been
greatly exaggerated. Henry remarked to Cromwell that she
was “nothing so fair as she had been reported,” that she was
”well and seemly, but nothing else”.<a name="FNanchor_239_239"
id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The wedding took
place on the feast of the Epiphany, 1540, with marked reluctance
on Henry’s part. He afterwards said that he would
never have married her, “but for fear of making a ruffle in
the world, and of driving her brother into the hands of the
Emperor and the French King”.<a name="FNanchor_240_240"
id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
But his discontent was
kept secret for a time, although the day after his marriage
he pointedly asked Cromwell, “What remedy?” Cromwell
said he knew of none, and hoped for the best. He had been
more facile in the case of Queen Katharine and of Anne
Boleyn, but his ingenuity seemed to have forsaken him at
the moment when it might have saved him from ruin. His
fall was as swift and as unforeseen by himself, as that of any
of the victims of his policy.</p>

<p>On the 11th June, the French ambassador wrote to Francis
I.: “I have just been informed that Master Thomas Cramvel
Keeper of the Privy Seal of this King, and his Vicar General
in things spiritual, who since the death of the Cardinal had
the principal management of the affairs of this kingdom and
had lately been made Grand Chamberlain, was an hour ago
led prisoner to the Tower of London, and all his goods seized
and confiscated. Although this might be thought a private
matter and of little importance, inasmuch as they have but
reduced a personage thus to the condition from which they
raised him, treating him only as they all say he deserved,
nevertheless, considering the consequence of the matter, ...
especially as regards the innovations in religion, of which the
said Cramvel had been the principal author, the news seems
to me of so much importance, that it ought to be communicated
forthwith.” Later on he adds:—</p>

<p>“Sire, as I was on the point of closing this letter, a gentleman
of the Court came to me from the King his master to
tell me not to be surprised that Cramvel had been sent to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Tower, and that as the common, ignorant people as usual
spoke of it variously, and in such a manner as to mislead one,
I might think and write accordingly, he wished me to know
the truth, and the reason why he had taken him all invested
in authority as he was”. He goes on to say that the King,
according to his own statement, wished to settle religious
matters in England on a Catholic basis, and was opposed by
Cromwell, who was in league with the German Lutherans, and
working against his master and the Acts of Parliament; that
he had betrayed himself, and said that he hoped to do away
with the old preachers, so that the new ones would be listened
to, adding that “the affair would soon be brought to such a
pass, that the King with all his power would not be able to
prevent it, but that his own party would be so strong that he
would make the King descend to the new doctrines, even if
he had to take arms against him, in which case, he reckoned
that he would not be inferior but rather superior in power,
and able to establish that which he had long proposed to do”.<a name="FNanchor_241_241"
id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>This was Henry’s version of his minister’s disgrace, and
there was, beyond doubt, an element of truth in it, but the
immediate irritating cause of Henry’s displeasure was, as we
shall presently see, Cromwell’s guilt in providing him with a
wife whom he disliked, and his inability to release him from
a bond, for the forming of which he was mainly responsible.
Meanwhile, Marillac gives an interesting description of Cromwell’s
arrest:—</p>

<p>“To begin with the day of his taking, in the Council
Chamber of this King’s house at Westminster—as soon as
the Lieutenant of the Tower declared the charge he had received
from the King, to take him prisoner, the said Cramvel,
moved with indignation, took off his cap and threw it on the
ground in a rage, saying to the Duke of Norfolk, and others
of the Privy Council there assembled, that this then was the
reward of his good services towards the King, and that he
appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor;
but as he was treated thus, he renounced all the mercy and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
pardon that might be done to him, as one who never thought
to have offended, and that all he asked of the King his master,
if he had such an opinion of him was, not to let him languish
long. Thereupon, some said he was a traitor, others that it
was meet he should be judged by the laws he had himself
made, which were so bloody, that often words which had been
spoken inadvertently, with a good intention, he had constituted
high treason. The Duke of Norfolk, having reproached him
with some villanies done by him, snatched off the order of St.
George, which he wore round his neck, and the Admiral, to
show himself as great an enemy in adversity, as he had been
thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then by
a door which opens upon the water, he was put into a boat,
and taken to the Tower, without the people of this city suspecting
it, until they saw all the King’s archers under Mr.
Cheyney at the door of the prisoner’s house, where they made
an inventory of his goods, which were not of such value as it
was thought, although too much for a fellow of his cloth.
The money was £7,000 sterling, equal to 28,000 crowns of
our currency, and the silver plate, including crosses, chalices,
mitres, vases and other spoils of the Church, might amount to
rather more. These moveables were taken before night to
the King’s treasury, which is a sign that they will not be
restored. The next day, were found several letters which he
had written to, or received from the German lords who
adhered to the doctrines of Luther. I have not been able to
learn their contents, except that this King was so embittered
against the said Cramvel, that he will no longer hear him
spoken of, but desires as soon as possible to abolish all memory
of him, as the meanest wretch ever born in England. To
begin, this King at once distributed all his offices as it pleased
him, and had it proclaimed that no one should call him Lord
Privy Seal or by any other title of estate, but only Thomas
Cramvel, Shearman, depriving him of all his privileges and
prerogatives of nobility, which he had before given him, dividing
his less valuable effects among the servants of the prisoner,
who were commanded no longer to wear their master’s livery.
Wherefore it is inferred, Sire, that the said Cramvel will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
be judged according to the solemnity used to the great of this
country, nor beheaded as they are, but will be dragged along
like an ignoble person, and afterwards hanged and quartered.
A few days will show, especially as they have resolved to
empty the Tower at this Parliament, which finishes with this
month.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242"
class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Cromwell’s tone of indignation, real or pretended, changed
to one of the humblest entreaty for mercy as soon as he was
lodged in the Tower. His letters to the King were contemptible.
Henry replied to them by ordering him to write
an account of all he knew about his marriage with Anne of
Cleves, and having had ample experience of his ex-minister’s
complaisance in his matrimonial affairs, he was justified in
thinking that Cromwell would not stick at trifles now. The
result was a detailed story of the whole matter, with the very
words that had passed between himself and the King, the
day after the marriage, most of which is unfit to print.<a name="FNanchor_243_243"
id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> But
nothing that he could write or say availed to save him; the
axe that he had so long held over the heads of the nation fell
at last on his own head, the only favour granted to him being the
manner of his death, for he had been condemned to be hanged.
According to the proceedings which he had himself instituted,
he was attainted in Parliament in his absence, and convicted
without a hearing. Hated by every member of the Council,
feared throughout the realm, disliked and suspected abroad,
he was regretted by none. Cranmer who had been his only
friend, styling him, “Mine own entirely beloved Cromwell,”
did as he had done on Anne Boleyn’s arrest, and wrote to
Henry that he stood amazed and grieved, but was glad as a
loyal subject, that Cromwell’s treasons had been discovered!<a name="FNanchor_244_244"
id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>The nation once more breathed freely, and even on the
continent considerable relief was felt. The Constable of
France said that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> “every honest man was much bound to
God and Henry, that Christendom should be dispatched of
such a ribald who thought to have my lady Mary in marriage”;
and the Portuguese ambassador in France was heard to say
that Henry was like to have made Cromwell a duke, and
then have given him his daughter, as he had given his sister
to the Duke of Suffolk, and that therefore Cromwell did his
best to break every marriage proposed for her. He swore
he could not remember who first told him, “but the bruit was
common among ambassadors two years past”.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the new Queen had been sent to Richmond,
ostensibly to be out of reach of the plague, and it was given
out that Henry would follow her there in a few days. But
proceedings for a divorce had been already instituted in
Parliament, and in an incredibly short space of time her
marriage with the King was declared null, by reason of her
pre-contract with the son of the Duke of Lorraine. She was
endowed with lands, to the value of £4,000 annually, with two
houses to live in, one at Richmond, the other at Bletchingly.</p>

<p>With this arrangement Anne was perfectly content. She
expressed her willingness to be divorced, and had desired the
Duke of Cleves’ messenger “to commend her to her brother
and say she was merry and well entreated. This she did with
such alacrity and pleasant gesture, that he may well testify
that he found her not miscontented. After she had dined,
she sent the King the ring delivered unto her at their pretended
marriage, desiring that it might be broken in pieces,
as a thing which she knew of no force or value.” Henry sent
her many gifts and tokens, “as his sister and none otherwise,”
in which capacity she was to be the first lady in the realm,
next after the Queen and the King’s children. In his letters
Henry exhorts her to be “quiet and merry,” which injunction
she seems to have obeyed, without any great effort, and he
subscribes himself “Your loving brother and friend”. A
<i>douceur</i> was administered to the Duke of Cleves, and all
parties concerned were as well pleased and friendly as possible.
After Henry’s fifth marriage, Anne was spoken of as “the old
Queen, the King’s sister”.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>Whatever others said of these startling events, Mary
apparently said nothing. Not a single remark of hers is
chronicled that might be an indication of her feelings on the
fall of Cromwell. He had been her greatest foe, but had
seemed in later years to befriend her, and she believed that
she owed her father’s restored favour to his intercession.
Whether he really aspired to her hand, and whether she knew
of it, must remain one of the mysteries of the reign. That he
had worked with Henry on her behalf is certain, and perhaps
her fear of him was balanced by gratitude, a sentiment which
Mary alone of all the Tudors seems to have cherished. Many
of her appeals to Cromwell had been penned in charitable
solicitude for servants of her own and her mother’s, for
she never forgot a service rendered, and never hesitated to
become importunate, where the welfare and comfort of her
dependants were concerned. Among a number of such appeals
is one of the year 1537, in which she desires him to
have in remembrance “mine earnest suit made unto you
for mistress Coke, my mother’s old servant, touching the farm
of Rysbridge, belonging to the new college in Oxford, the
warden whereof hath neither used you nor me, as I think
gently therein. And therefore, as my sheet-anchor, next the
king’s majesty, I recommend it wholly unto you, and even so
beseech our Lord to send you no worse to fare than I would
myself.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246"
class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>In December 1540, Henry married Katharine Howard,
grand-daughter of the Duke of Norfolk, whose reputation
was already so bad, that it is impossible to believe him to
have been ignorant of it. She complained to Henry of not
being treated by Mary with the same respect as she had
shown to the two preceding Queens. An attempt was made
about the same time to remove from the Princess’s household
two of her maidservants, a petty piece of persecution
which it was thought came from the new Queen’s hostility.
Some means of conciliation was however found, and the two
maids were allowed to remain, but this was not the only
trouble of the kind, for Chapuys, writing to the Queen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Hungary, says that Mary is well in health, “though exceedingly
distressed and sad, at the death of one of her damsels,
who has actually died of grief at having been removed from
her service by the King’s order”. Nevertheless, Mary had
been too well schooled in adversity to indulge in resentment,
and she sent Katharine a New Year’s present, with which
Henry was much pleased, as well as with her present to him,
and sent her messenger back to her with two magnificent
gifts from himself and the Queen. She still contrived to
hold herself aloof from the court, but the deposed Queen
Anne seems to have had no such scruple, and Marillac gives
a description of her New Year’s visit to the King and her
rival, which is too amusing to be passed over. In a letter to
Francis he says:—</p>

<p>“Sire, to omit nothing that may be written about this
country, Madame Anne, sister of the Duke of Cleves formerly
Queen of England, passed the recent festivities at Richmond,
four miles from Hampton Court, to which place, the King
and also the Queen sent her on the first day of the year
rich presents of clothes, plate and jewels, valued at six or
seven thousand crowns. And on the second day, she was
summoned to appear at Hampton Court, where she was
very honourably conducted by several of the nobility, and
being arrived, this king received her very graciously as did
also the queen, with whom she remained nearly the whole
afternoon. They danced together, and seemed so happy that
neither did the new queen appear to be jealous or afraid that
the other had come to raise the siege, as it was rumoured,
nor did the said lady of Cleves show any sign of discontent
at seeing her rival in her place. Moreover, Sire, if it please
you to hear the end of this farce, that evening and the next,
the two ladies supped at the King’s table together, although
the lady of Cleves sat a little backward in a corner, where the
Princess of England, Madame Mary is wont to be; and the
following day, the said lady of Cleves returned with the
same escort to Richmond, where she is visited by all the
personages of the court, which makes people think that she
is about to be reinstated in her former position.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247"
id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>
<p>In May, Henry and Katharine went to visit Prince Edward
at Mary’s request, “but chiefly,” says Chapuys, “at the intercession
of the Queen herself”. Henry gave Mary on this
occasion full permission to reside at court, “and the Queen,”
Chapuys adds, “has countenanced it with a good grace”.
Mary had therefore no choice but to spend the next few
months with her new stepmother, keeping outwardly on
good terms with her, and presenting a strange contrast to
her surroundings. When at last it suited Henry to have his
eyes opened to Katharine’s outrageously loose conduct, his
indignation, or that which passed for such, knew no bounds.
During her trial, the palace at Hampton Court, where she
was imprisoned, was so strictly guarded that none but certain
officers could enter or leave it. Mary was sent away, and her
father announced that he was heart-broken at the Queen’s
immorality and perfidy. Anne of Cleves was thought by
Chapuys to rejoice greatly at Katharine’s fall, but her execution
caused little comment throughout the country. Either
the people were indifferent to her fate, or they had become
accustomed to the disgrace of Queens consorts.</p>

<p>But for Mary there seemed no escape from tragedies.
The block was never long absent from her life, which was
often passed under its very shadow. When, in May 1541,
the Countess of Salisbury was beheaded, under peculiarly
aggravated circumstances, her goddaughter, on whose behalf
she indirectly suffered, might well walk in terror. The axe
had never before come so near Mary’s own head. Fear for
her safety was universal. The Emperor shared the common
apprehension, and was anxious to protect his cousin by seeming
to be on especially good terms with her father. Chapuys
therefore advised him no longer to address Henry as uncle,
for the title only served to reopen old sores, and for the
same reason, he thought it better to give up the word princess
in addressing Mary. The King having now a son, it might
be dropped without any loss of dignity, as it really implied
heiress to the Crown, a title to which she had no longer any
right.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248"
class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>
<p>But the constant anxiety in which she lived, resulted, as
often before, in a serious illness. Illness however was sometimes
her best friend, for when she was in danger of death
Henry would perhaps remember that she was the idolised
child of his youth, connected with his happier days, and would
hasten to show her that kindness and affection which always
helped to restore her to health. It was not until she appeared
to be <i>in extremis</i> that he could be roused to any degree of interest,
whereas Chapuys was ever ready with sympathy. Thus
on the 7th April 1542, he says that Mary had sent to him three
or four days ago, to thank him for certain letters which he had
written to her during her illness, saying that they had acted
“as a most health-restoring cordial to her”. And he ends,
“To say the truth, I did my very best to comfort and cheer
her in the midst of her ailments”. But she was still far from
recovery, and on the 22nd he writes to the Queen of Hungary,
“The Princess has not improved in health of late; on the
contrary, she has occasionally been in danger of her life. I
pray and beseech God to grant her more consolation and
pleasure than she has hitherto enjoyed.” Marillac also informed
Francis of the extremely critical state in which she
lay. However, at the end of the month, Chapuys reported
her convalescence, with the news that Henry was taking
great care of her, and that “with God’s help and good diet,”
it was hoped that she would shortly be well. From this time
onwards, till her father’s death, Mary’s lot improved, a fact
that may have been owing to the King’s marriage with
Katharine Parr, who had a great regard for the desolate girl.
In September, we find that “the King has just been entertaining
and feasting the Princess, beyond measure, presenting
her with certain rings and jewels”. She was recalled to
Hampton Court for the Christmas festivities, and was “triumphantly
attended, and accompanied on her passage through
London”. Henry received her kindly and “spoke the most
gracious and amiable words that a father could address to
his daughter”.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249"
class="fnanchor">[249]</a> On New Year’s Day, he presented her with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
more rings, silver plate and jewels, among which were two
rubies of inestimable value. In the course of the year, Chapuys
tells the Emperor that “the King continues to treat her kindly,
and has made her stay with the new Queen, who behaves
affectionately towards her. As to Anne Boleyn’s daughter,
the King has sent her back to stay with the Prince his son.”</p>

<p>Mary and Katharine had many tastes in common, and
were excellent companions. Both were fond of study, though
in an unequal degree, for to Mary it had been her only resource
and consolation, in the midst of her fiercest trials.
Friendships she had cultivated, as far as they were allowed
to her, but books had been her constant refuge, and the taste
for them once formed never forsook her. The New Learning
had found in her an apt pupil, and she had eagerly welcomed
the works of Erasmus, as they flowed from his facile and ever
industrious pen. His <i>Paraphrase on the New Testament</i> had
been printed in the year of her birth. It formed a part
of her education, and was the basis on which her piety was
founded. In later years, she translated a portion of it—“The
Paraphrase on the Gospel of St. John”—into English. Udal
gave it to the world with a translation of the whole work,
which he dedicated to Katharine Parr. In his preface he
says:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p>“And in this behalf, like as to your highness, most noble
Queen Catherine, for causing these paraphrases of the most
famous clerk and most godly writer, Erasmus of Rotterdam,
to be translated into our vulgar language, England can never
be able to render thanks sufficient; so may it never be able,
as her deserts require, enough to praise and magnify the most
noble, the most virtuous, the most witty, and the most studious
Lady Mary’s grace, daughter of the late most puissant and
victorious King Henry the Eighth, etc., it may never be able
I say, enough to praise and magnify her grace for taking such
great study, pain and travail in translating this paraphrase
of the said Erasmus upon the Gospel of St. John, at your
highness’ special contemplation, as a number of right well-learned
men both would have made courtesy at, and also
would have brought to worse frame in the doing.”</p>

<p>The book was published after Henry’s death, but a letter
from Katharine to Mary, and belonging to the year 1544, is
interesting as showing how much of it was really Mary’s own
work, and the arguments employed by the Queen to persuade
her to acknowledge the fact of her authorship publicly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Although most noble and dearest Lady, there are many
reasons that easily induce my writing to you at this time,
yet nothing so greatly moves me thereto as my concern for
your health, which as I hope is very good, so am I greatly
desirous to be assured thereof. Wherefore I despatch to you
this messenger, who will be (I judge) most acceptable to you,
not only from his skill in music, in which you, I am well
aware take as much delight as myself, but also because having
long sojourned with me, he can give the most certain information
of my whole estate and health. And in truth, I have
had it in my mind before this, to have made a journey to you,
and salute you in person; but all things do not correspond
with my will. Now however, I hope this winter, and that
ere long, that being nearer, we shall meet, than which, I
assure you, nothing can be to me more agreeable, and more
to my heart’s desire. Now since, as I have heard, the finishing
touch (as far as translation is concerned) is given by Mallet
to Erasmus’s work upon John, and nought now remains, but
that proper care and vigilance should be taken in revising, I
entreat you to send over to me this very excellent and useful
work, now amended by Mallet, or some of your people, that
it may be committed to the press in due time; and farther to
signify whether you wish it to go forth to the world (most
auspiciously) under your name, or as the production of an
unknown writer. To which work you will in my opinion do
a real injury, if you refuse to let it go down to posterity under
the auspices of your own name, since you have undertaken so
much labour in accurately translating it for the great good of
the public, and would have undertaken still greater (as is well
known) if the health of your body had permitted. And since
all the world knows that you have toiled and laboured much
in this business, I do not see why you should repudiate that
praise which all men justly confer on you. However, I leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
this whole matter to your discretion, and whatsoever resolution
you may adopt, that will meet my fullest approbation. For
the purse which you have sent me as a present, I return you
great thanks. I pray God, the greatest and best of beings
that He deign to bless you uninterruptedly with true and
unalloyed happiness. May you long fare well in him.</p>

<p>“From Hennworth, 20th September.</p>

<p>
“Most devotedly and lovingly yours,</p>

<p class="ar">“<span class="smcap">Catherine the Queen K.P.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_250_250"

<p>During the remaining three years of her father’s life, Mary
was allowed to lead her own quiet, studious life in peace. She
was held in very great consideration both at home and abroad;
ambassadors were instructed after receiving their first audience
of the King to visit “the most serene Queen Katharine Parr
and the most illustrious Princess, the King’s daughter”.</p>

<p>Negotiations for her marriage still continued, but were
nothing more than tactics of war to mislead the enemy, so
long as the purpose served. Duke Philip of Bavaria had
taken leave of her in January 1540, believing that he was soon
to return and claim his bride. The Emperor considered the
matter settled, and deep sympathy was felt for her at his
court in Brussels. Granvelle thought, however, that the
marriage must be suffered, provided she was made to consent
to nothing against her religion, and he sent over yet another
form of protestation to be used at the ceremony. In England
it was even reported that she was already married to the
Duke; and all these various comments were exactly what
Henry wished to call forth, without pledging himself irrevocably,
or having the least intention of concluding the treaty.
While Mary was sadly resigned to her fate, and all Europe
was pitying her, Henry was merely trifling with the German
Protestants for political reasons. But the trifling was of a
very solemn sort, and as late as 1546, a treaty was drawn up
but never signed, between the Duke of Bavaria and the Lady
Mary, in which it was provided that “the Duke shall transport
the Lady within three months, the King to give the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
12,000 florins, in hands towards her transporting”.<a name="FNanchor_251_251"
id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> It was
also enacted that her dowry was to consist of 40,000 florins
in gold, 20,000 to be paid on the day of her marriage, the
rest at Frankfort a year later.</p>

<p>But yet another aspirant, the Duke of Holstein, came
forward, and Henry played him off against Duke Philip, as
he had played Philip off against the Emperor and Francis I.,
and his son, without of course any definite result.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-eight Mary was still admired,
although bad health, and trouble of mind had left their marks
on a face, the beauty of which had been praised in such lavish
terms. In 1544 the secretary of the Duke of Najera merely
said of her, “The Princess Mary has a pleasing countenance
and person. The dress she wore was a petticoat of cloth of
gold and gown of violet-coloured three-piled velvet, with a
head-dress of many rich stones.” It was in this year that she
sat to the now unknown painter, for the portrait which has
passed into the National Portrait Gallery. The somewhat
hard outlines of the picture betoken a hand far less skilful
than that of Holbein, who painted her earlier, or that of Sir
Antonio More and Lucas Van Heere, who painted her later
portraits. It will be observed that the style of dress resembles
that of the more pleasing Oxford portrait, which must have
been executed about the same time.</p>

<p>Henry’s various machinations were cut short by death, and
Mary’s troubles were henceforth to take an entirely different
form.</p>

had no children, it would be a great pleasure to him to see his son Orleans
marry Lady Mary of England, and he was to inquire of her physician whether
all she had suffered would not prevent her bearing children (Gairdner, <i>Cal.</i>,

<p class="ac noindent">THE KING’S SISTER.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">1547-1553.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of her father’s death, Mary was thirty-one years
old. Her youth had passed away amid storms such as few
women are called upon to weather, and they had left their
traces on her character no less than on the brilliant beauty
for which she had been famed throughout Europe. The
slightly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mutine</span></i> expression, which we notice in Holbein’s
fascinating portrait, had changed into a thoughtful, self-contained
and rather sad look. She had acquired a thorough
knowledge of the world, of men’s foibles, ambitions, passions
and intrigues, and thus came well-equipped and undismayed
into the new struggle that awaited her with her brother’s
Privy Council. In spite of her many friends (for her popularity
had increased rather than diminished) she was necessarily
somewhat isolated in her exalted position, and her enemies
were powerful.</p>

<p>By the terms of her father’s will she was now the first
lady in the land, being placed in the line of succession,
as was her right, immediately after Edward, in default of
male heirs of his body. Projects were formed for her marriage
with the Duke of Ferrara, with the King of Poland,
with Albert Marquis of Brandenburg, and with Don Loys
of Portugal, who was again put forward as a suitable husband,
but the Council were not more eager to send her out
of the country than Henry had been.</p>

<p>So far as Edward was allowed to entertain any warmth
of affection, he was, it may be said, sincerely attached to both
his sisters, but he was entirely a puppet in the hands of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
uncles the Seymours. He was nine years old at the time of
his accession, and but for them might have regarded Mary
something in the light of a mother. She was in fact his
godmother, and had watched over him as well as circumstances
would allow, from his birth, but those who surrounded
him were careful that her interest in her young brother should
not assume a more definite shape than the bestowal of countless
presents, and the constant providing of juvenile amusements.
One of his letters to her shortly before his father’s
death contains a pretty passage: “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amo te, sicut frater debet
amare charissimam sororem, quæ habet omnia ornamenta
virtutis et honestatis in se</span></i>”.<a name="FNanchor_252_252"
id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
In May 1546, he told her that
God had given her the wisdom of Esther, and that he looked
up to her virtues with admiration.<a name="FNanchor_253_253"
id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>
But scarcely was he on
the throne, when his uncles made him the mouthpiece of the
narrow Puritan views to which they were committed, and we
find him writing to Katharine Parr, to entreat her “to preserve
his dear sister Mary from the enchantments of the Evil One,
by beseeching her to attend no longer to foreign dances and
merriments, which do not become a Christian princess”. When
left to himself, however, he showed her simple, child-like
affection.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254"
class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The rapid decline of Henry’s health had been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
signal to the Seymours to seize what extra power they could.
They even went so far as to amend the King’s will, a few days
before his death, conferring on themselves more authority
than had been already decreed. Henry had refused to sign
the amendment, but they, disguising the fact that it did not
bear the royal sign manual, carried matters with so high a
hand that their powers were taken for granted. The supreme
authority had originally been vested in sixteen executors, but
the two Seymours claimed the entire guardianship of the
boy-king. Henry had had little regard for his brothers-in-law.
He knew them to be ambitious, and had been sparing
of his favours towards them. He suspected them moreover
of a secret fondness for the new doctrines, to which he was
again strenuously opposed, but as there was no kinsman of the
blood royal to whom he could confide his son, he was obliged
to accept the inevitable.</p>

<p>Thomas and Edward Seymour were at Henry’s death,
the one a simple knight, the other Earl of Hertford and
Lord Chamberlain. Not content with these mediocre honours,
they at once busied themselves with their own advancement.
Hertford caused himself to be created Duke of Somerset,
while Sir Thomas was made Lord Seymour of Sudley. Besides
this, the latter coveted the patent of High Admiral, held
by the Earl of Warwick, and as with the Seymours to covet
was to have, Warwick was obliged to resign the patent in his
favour. Neither of the brothers was sensitive in regard to
the outspoken criticism of the other members of the Council,
who suggested that it would have been well to await the
King’s majority, to be rewarded according to their merits;
and in spite of murmurs of dissatisfaction the new Duke of
Somerset had himself proclaimed Protector, and procured
letters patent under the Great Seal, conferring on his person
the whole authority of the Crown.</p>

<p>The ambition of Admiral Seymour had, it is said, further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
led him to solicit the hand of Elizabeth, immediately after her
father’s death,<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255"
class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and, meeting with a rebuff, he at once offered
himself to the widowed Queen, greatly to the indignation of
Henry’s daughters when the fact became known to them. The
indecency of the proceeding could scarcely have been more
accentuated, for as soon as Henry’s body was laid in the
tomb, the Admiral was secretly married to Katharine Parr.</p>

<p>Henry died on the 28th January, and an undated letter
from Katharine to the Admiral, bearing intrinsic evidence
that she was his wife when she wrote it, also contains irrefragable
proof that it could not have been written later than
the middle of February next following.<a name="FNanchor_256_256"
id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Thus the marriage
was an accomplished fact weeks before his appeal to Edward
for permission to marry his stepmother. To marry a queen
dowager, without the royal consent was a misdemeanour involving
fine and imprisonment, and he therefore by means
of flattery, and by supplying the boy secretly with large sums
of money, so wormed himself into his favour, that Edward
being made aware of his uncle’s wishes, affectionately urged
him to marry Katharine, and afterwards thanked him for
doing so. It is probable that Henry’s children never knew
the extent to which they had been deceived, although in the
subsequent indictment of Seymour, one of the charges brought
against him was, that he had married the Queen Dowager so
quickly after the King’s death, that if she had had a child
within the next nine months, disputes might well have arisen
regarding the succession.</p>

<p>There had been little difficulty in gaining Edward’s consent,
but it was no such plain sailing to win Mary’s good-will
towards the marriage. In spite of all she had suffered at her
father’s hands, Mary was astonishingly devout to his memory,
and her letter in answer to the Admiral’s hypocritical pleading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
that she would intercede with the Queen in his behalf, when
he had already been married to her for months, is dignified
and sensible.</p>

<p>The marriage was concealed till the end of June, when it
was supposed to have taken place at Edward’s request.
Elizabeth’s indignation, real or feigned, was thus expressed
in a letter to Mary:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Princess, and very dear Sister</span>,</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
<p>“You are very right in saying, in your most acceptable
letters which you have done me the honour of writing to
me, that our interests being common, the just grief we feel in
seeing the ashes, or rather the scarcely cold body of the
King our father so shamefully dishonored by the Queen our
stepmother, ought to be common to us also. I cannot express
to you, my dear Princess, how much affliction I suffered when
I was first informed of this marriage, and no other comfort
can I find, than that of the necessity of submitting ourselves
to the decrees of heaven; since neither you nor I, dearest
sister, are in such a condition as to offer any obstacle thereto,
without running heavy risk of making our own lot much
worse than it is, at least so I think. We have to deal with
too powerful a party who have got all authority into their
hands, while we, deprived of power cut a very poor figure at
court. I think then, that the best course we can take is that
of dissimulation, that the mortification may fall upon those
who commit the fault. For we may rest assured that the
memory of the King our father, being so glorious in itself,
cannot be subject to these stains which can only defile the
persons who have wrought them. Let us console ourselves
by making the best of what we cannot remedy. If our silence
does us no honour, at least it will not draw down upon us
such disasters as our lamentations might induce. These are
my sentiments, which the little reason I have dictates, and
which guides my respectful reply to your agreeable letter.
With regard to the returning of visits, I do not see that you
who are the elder are obliged to this; but the position in
which I stand obliges me to take other measures, the Queen
having shown me so great affection, and done me so many
kind offices, that I must use much tact in manœuvring with
her, for fear of appearing ungrateful for her benefits. I shall
not however, be in any hurry to visit her, lest I should be
charged with approving what I ought to censure. However
I shall always pay much deference to your instructions and
commands, in all which you shall think convenient or serviceable
to you, as being your highness’s,” etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_258_258"

<p>Although we have no authority but Leti, for the authenticity
of this letter, a remarkable production for a girl of
thirteen, it cannot be denied that there is a striking resemblance
between the shrewdness displayed therein, and the
clever fencing in which Elizabeth afterwards so greatly excelled.
Before long, the writer was an inmate of the Queen’s
household, and an adept in that “dissimulation” which she
recommended to Mary. The Admiral, already repenting his
hasty marriage, was carrying on an intrigue with Elizabeth,
whom Katharine one day surprised in his arms; and there
were rumours of still greater familiarities. The unhappy
Queen died soon after in childbed, and an inquiry into the
nature of Elizabeth’s relations with the Admiral revealed a
sink of depravity and corruption. But self-defence was an
art in which Elizabeth excelled, and in the characteristic
words of Mrs. Ashley, her governess, “She would not cough
out more matter than it suited her purpose to confess”.<a name="FNanchor_259_259"
id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, so great was the enmity between the Protector
and his brother, each seeking to supplant the other with the
King, that Edward could scarcely be expected to retain a
spark of natural affection for either. Somerset, bent on the
Admiral’s ruin, accused him of a design for upsetting the
Government, and caused him to be attainted for high treason,
without bringing the least particle of real evidence against
him. There is something repulsive in the succinct manner
in which the whole affair of his uncle’s attainder and execution
is disposed of in the young King’s Journal: “Also the Lord
Sudley, Admiral of England was condemned to death, and
died in the March ensuing”.<a name="FNanchor_260_260"
id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>But these were days when human life was held cheap, and
not only did Somerset sign the warrant for his brother’s
execution, but Cranmer, who, as a Churchman, was prohibited
by Canon law from all participation in judgments of blood,
did not refrain from setting his sign manual to the deed.<a name="FNanchor_261_261"
id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
Latimer preached the funeral sermon, which, in his anxiety
to curry favour with the Council, became a further indictment.
“Whether he be saved or no, I leave it to God,” said the
Bishop of Worcester, “but surely he was a wicked man, and
the realm is well rid of him.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262"
id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The Protector did not long enjoy his triumph over his
brother. His assumption of the supreme power in the State
was an eyesore to others besides the Admiral. The Earl of
Warwick soon proved a redoubtable adversary and rival in the
Council, and accused him of arbitrary and tyrannical abuse
of his authority.</p>

<p>Edward, who sometimes smarted under the despotic control
of his uncle, was not unwilling to be released therefrom,
and was easily persuaded to sign a writ for his committal to
the Tower. The arrest of the most powerful advocate of the
new doctrines appeared to the reformers to threaten the existence
of all that they had worked for with so much success, and
it was felt that the decisive moment had arrived, for striking
a final blow for the total abolition of the old faith.</p>

<p>Henry’s last years had been marked by a strong reaction in
its favour. This reaction had set in with Cromwell’s waning influence,
had not a little to do with the Chief Secretary’s disgrace,
and had continued till his own death, at which time he was
more Catholic than he had ever been since his youth. In his
anxiety to guard against the introduction of Genevan heresies
into England, he revived the statute against Lollardy, and
the Protestants were burned for propagating the new opinions.
Stringent measures were adopted to prevent the importation
of books concerning religion from the continent, and in his
last will, Henry put his belief in the Mass on record, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
ordering that it should be offered daily, “perpetually while
the world shall endure,” for the repose of his soul. Edward
VI. had been crowned according to ancient Catholic rites, so
far as the religious part of the ceremonies was concerned,
although several departures from precedent were made as
regarded the administration of the oath. High Mass concluded
the ceremony. But in two years, vast changes had
come about, mainly through Somerset’s influence, and a
circular letter had been sent to the clergy, informing them
of the King’s intention to proceed with the reformation of
the Church of England. They were commanded to deliver
up all books containing any portion of the service of the
Mass, that such might be burnt, or destroyed publicly. An
act was passed ordering that “all books, manuals, legends,
pics, grailes, primers in Latin and English, journals, ordinals
or other books or writings whatsoever, heretofore used for
service of the Church, written or printed in the English or
Latin tongue, other than such as shall be set forth of the
King’s Majesty, shall be by authority of this present act,
clearly and utterly abolished, extinguished and forbidden for
ever to be used or kept in this realm, or elsewhere within
any of the King’s dominions”.<a name="FNanchor_263_263"
id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>It was further enacted, that all images already taken out
of the churches and chapels should be utterly defaced and
destroyed by the mayor, bailiff, constable or churchwardens
within three months, under the penalty of ten shillings for
the first default, four pounds for the second, and imprisonment
during the King’s pleasure for the third.<a name="FNanchor_264_264"
id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Those bishops who resisted the new laws were sent to the
Tower, among them were Heath, Day and Gardiner, who
denounced as illegal all ecclesiastical changes made during
the King’s minority. Cranmer had long since joined the
Protestant party, and it was observed in 1549 that “this year
the Archbishop of Canterbury did eat meat openly in Lent
in the hall of Lambeth, the like of which was never seen
since England was a christian country”. But the proceedings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of the Council were marked by singular inconsistency, for
although most of the changes tended towards a shaking off
of old beliefs, freedom of conscience was by no means allowed.
The statute <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Heresia</span></i>
was again called into play, and a
woman was tried, condemned and burned for denying the Incarnation
of our Lord. On the 2nd May 1549, Edward wrote
in his Diary, “Joan Bocher, otherwise called Joan of Kent,
was burnt for holding that Christ was not incarnate of the
Virgin Mary, being condemned the year before, but kept in
hope of conversion, and the 30 of April, the bishop of
London, and the bishop of Ely were to persuade her. But
she withstood them, and reviled the preacher that preached
at her death.” The three bishops, Hooper, Latimer and
Ridley followed Cranmer’s lead, and distinguished themselves
in the cause of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_265_265"
id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
But the people rose in
protest, a revolt that was everywhere stamped out in blood.
Cranmer’s <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> superseded the Missal and
Breviary, and an order of the Privy Council provided that
from thenceforth, “no printer should print or put into vent
any English book but such as should first be examined by
Mr. Secretary Petre, Mr. Secretary Smith, and Mr. Cecil, or
the one of them, and allowed by the same, under pain of
imprisonment”.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266"
class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The triumph of the Reformation all along the line was
celebrated by the pardon and release of Somerset, on his
subscribing a document consisting of twenty-nine charges
brought against him, in which he was made to confess his
presumption, negligence and incapacity.</p>

<p>During this time, Mary was living, for the most part, in
great retirement, at her favourite residence, Beaulieu (New
Hall) in Essex, rarely appearing at court, and hoping that by
attracting little attention she might be able to practise her
religion unmolested. The Mass, although abolished by Act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of Parliament, and celebrated only at the risk of pains and
penalties, was still said openly in her house. The Statute of
Uniformity by which heavy penalties were inflicted on all
priests saying Mass, and on every individual who should be
found present at Mass, was a formidable weapon in Somerset’s
hands. The Protector summoned Mary, in his capacity as
head of the Council, to embrace the new form of worship.
Her answer was a spirited protest:—</p>

<p>“It is no small grief to me to perceive that they whom
the King’s Majesty my father (whose soul God pardon) made
in this world of nothing, in respect of that they be come to
now, and at this last end, put in trust to see his will performed,
whereunto they were all sworn upon a book (it grieveth me I
say) for that love I bear to them, to see both how they break
his will, what usurped power they take upon them, in making
(as they call it) laws, clean contrary to his proceedings and will,
and also against the custom of all Christendom, and in my
conscience, against the law of God and his Church, which
passeth all the rest. But though you among you have forgotten
the King my father, yet both God’s commandment
and nature will not suffer me to do so, wherefore with God’s
help, I will remain an obedient child to his laws as he left
them, till such time as the King’s Majesty, my brother shall
have perfect years of discretion, to order the power that God
hath sent him, to be a judge in these matters himself, and I
doubt not, he shall then accept my so doing better than theirs,
who have taken a piece of his power upon them in his
minority.”<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267"
class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

<p>On the 22nd June 1549, she was admonished to send her
chaplain and comptroller of her household before the Council,
but she replied haughtily that she could not spare her comptroller,
and that her chaplain had been sick, that the law made
by Parliament was not worth the name of a law, that King
Henry’s executors were sworn to his statutes, that her house
was her flock, and that she deferred in obedience to King
Edward’s laws, till his Majesty were of sufficient years, all of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
which of course gave great offence. Nevertheless, Edward,
in a letter dated August 1549, merely marvelled at his sister’s
refusal to conform to the order of Common Prayer lately set
forth, and gave a dispensation to the Princess and her household
to have private service in her own chamber.<a name="FNanchor_268_268"
id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p>The secret of this forbearance lay in the fact that Mary
had appealed to the Emperor, who had threatened war if she
were molested, and as the country was already entangled in
hostilities with France, Edward’s Council thought it prudent
to allow her temporarily to practise the old religion. But as
soon as peace was signed, and friendship with the Emperor
was less important, messengers were again sent to her, and
letters from the King, offering to supply her with teachers,
who would instruct her ignorance and refute her errors. The
permission to have Mass, granted at the point of the sword,
was declared to have been limited to a few months only, and
to have included none of her servants. She was again warned
“to be conformable and obedient to the observation of his
Majesty’s laws, to give order that the Mass should be no more
used in her house, and that she would embrace and cause to
be celebrated in her said house, the communion and other
divine services set forth by his Majesty”.<a name="FNanchor_269_269"
id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>On the 3rd February 1551, Mary thus wrote to the King:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My duty most humbly remembered to your Majesty,
please it the same to understand, that I have received your
letters by Master Throckmorton this bearer; the contents
whereof do more trouble me than any bodily sickness, though
it were even to the death; and the rather for that your highness
doth charge me to be both a breaker of your laws, and also
an encourager of others to do the like. I most humbly beseech
your Majesty to think that I never intended towards
you otherwise than my duty compelleth me unto; that is to
wish your highness all honour and prosperity, for the which I
do and daily shall pray. And where as it pleaseth your Majesty
to write, that I make a challenge of a promise made otherwise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
than it was meant, the truth is, the promise could not be
denied before your Majesty’s presence, at my last waiting
upon the same. And although I confess the ground of faith
(whereunto I take reason to be but an handmaid) and my
conscience also hath and do agree with the same, yet touching
that promise, for so much as it hath pleased your Majesty
(God knoweth by whose persuasion) to write ‘it was not so
meant’; I shall most humbly desire your Highness to examine
the truth thereof indifferently, and either will your Majesty’s
ambassador now being with the Emperor, to inquire of the
same, if it be your pleasure to have him move it, or else to
cause it to be demanded of the Emperor’s ambassador here,
although he were not within this realm at that time....</p>

<p>“And albeit your Majesty (God be praised) hath at these
years as much understanding and more, than is commonly seen
in that age, yet considering you do hear but one part (your
Highness not offended) I would be a suitor to the same, that till
you were grown to more perfect years, it might stand with your
pleasure to stay, in matters touching the soul: so undoubtedly
should your Majesty know more, and hear others, and nevertheless
be at your liberty, and do your will and pleasure.
And whatsoever your Majesty hath conceived of me, either
by letters to your council or by their report, I trust in the
end to prove myself as true to you as any subject within your
realm, and will by no means stand in argument with your
Majesty, but in most humble wise beseech you even for
God’s sake, to suffer me as your Highness hath done hitherto.
It is for no worldly respect I desire it, God is my judge: but
rather than to offend my conscience I would desire of God to
lose all that I have, and also my life, and nevertheless live and
die your humble sister and true subject. Thus, after pardon
craved of your Majesty, for my rude and bold writing, I
beseech Almighty God to preserve the same in honour, with
as long continuance of health and life as ever had noble king.
From Beaulieu the third of Feb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 18th March, Edward made the following entry in
his Journal:—</p>

<p>“The Lady Mary my sister came to me at Westminster,
where after salutations, she was called with my Council into
a chamber, where was declared how long I had suffered her
Mass, in hope of her reconciliation and how now being no
hope, which I perceived by her letters, except I saw some
short amendment, I could not bear it. She answered that
her soul was God’s, and her faith she would not change, nor
dissemble her opinion with contrary doings. It was said I
constrained not her faith, but willed her not as a king to rule,
but as a subject to obey, and that her example might breed
too much inconvenience.”</p>

<p>On the 19th and 20th he added:—</p>

<p>“The Emperor’s ambassador came with a short message
from his master, of war if I would not suffer his cousin, the
princess to use her mass. To this was no answer given at
this time. The bishops of Canterbury, London and Rochester
did consider [that] to give licence to sin was sin; to suffer
and wink at it for a time might be borne, so all haste possible
might be used.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271"
class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>Already the Council had written to Sir Richard Morysine,
their envoy extraordinary at the court of Charles V., to inform
him that “of late the Emperor’s ambassador has moved them
that the Lady Mary might freely retain the ancient religion
in such sort as her father left it in this realm, according to
a promise made to the Emperor, till the King should be of
more years. They denied that such promise had been made,
except to this extent, that the King was content to bear with
her infirmity, that she should for a season hear the mass in
her closet or privy chamber only, whereat there should be
present no more than they of her chamber, and no time appointed,
but left to the King’s pleasure. But in spite of their
repeated assurances, that no promise had been made, he would
not receive their flat denial.”<a name="FNanchor_272_272"
id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<p>But Morysine was not a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">persona grata</span></i>
with the Emperor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and the Council sent over Dr. Wotton in the hope of propitiating
him. From Augsburg, where the imperial court
was then residing, Morysine wrote to the Council saying that
he was in no better favour than any in his case would be,
though the Emperor had changed his testiness for a more
gentle behaviour towards him. But he does not desire to
buy the Emperor’s love at the price at which he holds it, and
he is certain that he shall not hereafter be able to live on it.
The fault, he begs their Lordships to believe, lies in the
matter and not in him, and he continues: “Mr. Wotton hath
a more mannerly nay than I had, but even as flat a nay as
mine was. The Emperor’s choler spent upon me hath taught
him to use others with more gentleness.”<a name="FNanchor_273_273"
id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>Wotton’s account of his interview with Charles is extremely
interesting. The Emperor said: “Ought it not suffice you
that ye spill your own souls, but that ye have a mind to force
others to lose theirs too? My cousin, the Princess is evil-handled
among you, her servants plucked from her, and she,
still cried upon to leave Mass, to forsake her religion, in which
her mother, her grandmother, and all our family have lived
and died.” Wotton told him that when he left England, she
was honourably entertained, in her own house, with such
about her as she best liked, and he thought she must be so
still, since not hearing to the contrary, he was driven to think
there was no change. “Yes, by St. Mary,” saith he, “of
late they handle her evil, and therefore, say you hardly to
them, I will not suffer her to be evil-handled by them. I
will not suffer it. Is it not enough that mine aunt, her mother
was evil entreated by the King that dead is, but my cousin
must be worse ordered by councillors now? I had rather
she died a thousand deaths, than that she should forsake her
faith and mine. The King’s Majesty is too young to skill of
such matters.” Hereupon, Wotton, professing that it became
him not to dispute with his Majesty, yet being forced somewhat
to answer him, said that he knew the King was young
in years, but yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
“the Lord be praised for his gifts poured
upon him, as able to give an account of his faith as any prince
in Christendom being of thrice his years. And as for the
Lady Mary, tho’ she had a king to her father, hath a king to
her brother and is akin to the Emperor, yet in England there
is but one king, and the king hath but one law to rule all
his subjects by. The Lady Mary being no king must content
herself to be a subject.”</p>

<p>“A gentle law I tell you,” said he, “that is made, the
King’s majesty being no ——” (illegible).</p>

<p>Wotton then asked, that Chamberlain, the English ambassador
in ordinary, might have the service of the Book of
Common Prayer in his house, without access of strangers.
But the Emperor exclaimed, “English service in Flanders!
speak not of it. I will suffer none to use any doctrine or
service in Flanders that is not allowed of the Church.” If
his cousin the Lady Mary might not have her Masses, he
would provide for her a remedy, and in case his ambassador
were restrained from serving of God, he had already given
him order that if the restraint come to-day, that he should
to-morrow depart.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274"
class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>The Council replied to Wotton’s letter, that the Lady Mary
might no longer do as she had done, and that the laws would
be henceforth executed in her house. They concluded their
ultimatum by saying that “his Majesty also considers the
Emperor’s demands for his ambassador in England to use the
Mass, and his denial to suffer his Majesty’s ambassador within
his dominions to use the Communion, too much unequal and
unreasonable, and therefore he doubts not the Emperor will
otherwise consider this matter”.</p>

<p>The law of Uniformity once passed, Edward’s ministers
could only justify it by carrying it out logically; but in thus
doing they cut through marrow and bone, and the acts of
the Privy Council show the drastic nature of their dealings
with the disobedient. On the 19th March, Sergeant Morgan
had been summoned before the Council for hearing Mass
at St. John’s, in the Lady Mary’s house, two or three days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
previously, “and not being able to excuse himself, because
that, being a learned man, he should give so ill an example
to others, he was committed to the Fleet prison”.<a name="FNanchor_275_275"
id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>On the 24th, Sir Anthony Browne was examined as to
whether he had of late heard any Mass or not, when he
answered, “that indeed twice or thrice at the New Hall; and
once at Romford, as my Lady Mary was coming hither about
ten days past, he had heard Mass. Which being considered
as a notable ill example, was thought requisite to be corrected,
and therefore he was committed to the Fleet.”<a name="FNanchor_276_276"
id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>On the same day, Rochester, Comptroller of Mary’s
household, was interrogated as to “how many ordinary chaplains
her Grace had”. He answered that she had four, namely
Drs. Mallet, Hopton, Barker and Ricardes. But it was not
until August that definite steps were taken to coerce the
Princess into subjection. The story of the proceedings as
it is told in the <i>Acts of the Privy Council</i> is dramatic.<a name="FNanchor_277_277"
id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<p>The English envoys having signified to the Emperor
the ultimatum of Edward’s government on the 9th August,
on the 15th, three of Mary’s servants, Rochester, Waldegrave
and Sir Francis Englefield appeared before the Council, and
were commanded on their return home, to call Mary’s chaplains
together, and to inhibit them from further saying Mass
in her house, or in any other place, contrary to the King’s
laws, under pain of the King’s high indignation and displeasure.
As Rochester made many excuses “to avoid
the report of this matter unto her Grace and the execution
thereof in her house, he was finally commanded on
his allegiance to see it performed, and in case her Grace
should dismiss him, and the rest out of her service, upon the
receipt of this message (as he pretended she would) then
was he and the rest commanded on the King’s Majesty’s
behalf, neither to avoid her service nor to depart from her
house, but to see this order prescribed unto them fulfilled
until they should have further commandment from hence”.<a name="FNanchor_278_278"
id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>They were then dismissed, and returned to Mary, but were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
summoned to appear again on the 24th, to give an account of
their doings. In the meanwhile, the Princess wrote the following
letter to Edward, which was perhaps more forcible than
anything she had hitherto said in her defence:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My duty most humbly remembered unto your Majesty.
It may please the same to be advertised, that I have by my
servants received your most honourable letter, the contents
whereof do not a little trouble me, and so much the more for
that any of my servants should move or attempt me in
matters touching my soul, which I think the meanest subjects
within your realm could evil bear at their servants’ hands;
having for my part utterly refused heretofore to talk with
them in such matters, and of all other persons least regarded
them therein; to whom I have declared what I think, as she
which trusted that your Majesty would have suffered me, your
poor humble sister and beadswoman, to have used the accustomed
Mass, which the King your father and mine, with
all his predecessors evermore used; wherein also I have been
brought up from my youth, and thereunto my conscience
doth not only bind me, which by no means will suffer me to
think one thing and do another, but also the promise made
to the Emperor, by your Majesty’s Council, was an assurance
to me, that in so doing I should not offend the laws, although
they seem now to qualify and deny the thing. And at my
last waiting upon your Majesty, I was so bold to declare my
mind and conscience to the same, and desired your Highness
rather than you should constrain me to leave the Mass, to
take my life, whereunto your Majesty made me a very gentle
answer. And now I beseech your Highness to give me leave
to write what I think touching your Majesty’s letters. Indeed
they be signed with your own hand, and nevertheless in my
opinion not your Majesty’s in effect, because it is well known
(as heretofore I have declared in the presence of your Highness)
that although our Lord be praised, your Majesty hath
far more knowledge, and greater gifts than others of your
years, yet it is not possible that your Highness can at these
years be a judge in matters of religion. And therefore I take
it, that the matter in your letter proceedeth from such as do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
wish these things to take place, which be most agreeable
to themselves, by whose doings (your Majesty not offended)
I intend not to rule my conscience. And thus, without
molesting your Highness any further, I humbly beseech the
same, ever for God’s sake to bear with me as you have done,
and not to think that by my doings or ensample any inconvenience
might grow to your Majesty, or your realm; for I
use it not after any such sort, putting no doubt but in time to
come, whether I live or die, your Majesty shall perceive mine
intent is grounded upon a true love towards you, whose royal
estate I beseech Almighty God long to continue, which is and
shall be my daily prayer, according to my duty. And after
pardon craved of your Majesty, for these rude and bold letters,
if neither at my humble suit, nor for regard of the promise
made to the Emperor, your Highness will suffer and bear
with me as you have done, till your Majesty may be a judge
herein yourself, and right understand their proceedings (of
which your goodness yet I despair not) otherwise rather than
offend God and my conscience, I offer my body at your will,
and death shall be more welcome than life with a troubled
conscience.</p>

<p>“Most humbly beseeching your Majesty to pardon my
slowness in answering your letters, for my old disease would
not suffer me to write any sooner. And thus I pray Almighty
God to keep your Majesty in all virtue and honour, with good
health and long life to his pleasure.</p>

<p>“From my poor house at Copped Hall, the xix of August.</p>

<p>On the 24th, the officers of Mary’s household appeared
duly before the Lords, and in the words of the minutes of
the Privy Council, “declared unto their Lordships that upon
Saturday the 15th of this present, they arrived at Copped-hall
somewhat before night, by reason whereof they did not
the same night execute their charge committed to them at
Hampton Court, the 14th of this present. The Sunday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
following, being the 16th of this present, because they understood
that her Grace received the Sacrament, for so they
termed it, they did abstain to deliver their letters before noon,
considering that the same would trouble and disquiet her
so as after dinner, taking commodity to deliver their letters,
after that her Grace had read them, they made offer to her to
declare what charge they had received of the Lords to execute,
praying her Grace to be contented to hear the same. Whereunto
her Grace made answer, that she knew right well that their
commission was agreeing with such matter as was contained
in her letters, and that therefore they need not to rehearse the
same, howbeit they pressing her Grace, she was finally content
to hear them. And when they had said, she seemed to be
marvellously offended with them, and charged them that they
should not declare that same they had in charge to say, neither
to her chaplains nor family, which if they did, besides that
they should not take her hereafter for their mistress, she would
immediately depart out of the house. Upon this, the said
Rochester, Inglesfeld (<i>sic</i>) and Walgrave said to the Lords that
forasmuch as she oftentimes altered her colour, and seemed
to be passioned and unquiet, they forbare to trouble her any
further, fearing that the troubling of her might perchance bring
her to her old disease, and besought her to consider the matter
with herself, and pause thereupon against Wednesday next,
when they would wait on her Grace, and know her further
pleasure; which they said they did, hoping to have found her
then, upon more ripe deliberation, and debating of the matter
with herself, more conformable. And in the meantime, they
forbare also to declare to her chaplains and household the
charge they had received. But replying to her Grace, the
Wednesday, being the xxth of this present, they did not only
not find her conformable, but in further choler than she was
before, utterly forbidding them to make declaration of their
said charge and commission to her chaplains and household;
adding that where she and her household were in quiet, if they
would by any means disturb her and them, if any inconvenience
did ensue thereof to her or them she would erect it to the said
Rochester, Inglefeld and Walgrave, which thing considered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
they thought it better to return without doing their commission,
and declare thus much to their Lordships, without meddling
any further, than to proceed in the execution of their charge
before they had advertised their Lordships of the premisses.”<a name="FNanchor_280_280"
id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>They brought with them Mary’s letters of the 19th, addressed
to the King, and the next day were again summoned
to receive a sharp rebuke for having “troubled her Grace”
with delivering their message to her, contrary to the directions
given to them, and for doing nothing in regard to the prohibition
to her chaplains and household. They were then each
commanded separately, to return and do the business required
of them. But this they one and all refused to do, Rochester
and Waldegrave saying that they would rather endure any
punishment, and Sir Francis Inglefield declaring that he could
find it neither in his heart nor his conscience to do so. They
were therefore dismissed, with orders to be in readiness to
appear, whenever their Lordships should summon them, until
such time as they should know their further pleasure. Meanwhile,
the Lord Chancellor Rich, Sir William Petre, one of
the secretaries, and Sir Anthony Wingfield, Comptroller of
his Majesty’s Household, repaired to Copt Hall, taking with
them “a trusty skylfull man” who, it was intended, should for
the time being replace Rochester in the management of Mary’s
household. The following is their own account of their proceedings:—</p>

<p>“Windsor, 29th August 1551. First having received
commandment and instructions from the King’s Majesty,
we repaired to the said Lady Mary’s house at Copthall in
Essex, on Friday last, being the 28th of this instant, in the
morning, where, shortly after our coming, I, the Lord Chancellor
delivered his Majesty’s letters unto her, which she
received upon her knees, saying that for the honour of the
King’s Majesty’s hand, wherewith the said letters were signed,
she would kiss the letters, and not for the matter contained
in them, for the matter (said she) I take to proceed not from
his Majesty, but from you of the Council. In the reading of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the letter, which she did read secretly to herself, she said these
words in our hearing—’Ah! good Mr. Cecil took much pain
here’. When she had read the letters, we began to open the
matter of our instructions unto her. And as I, the Lord
Chancellor began, she prayed me to be short, for (said she) I
am not well at ease; and I will make you a short answer,
notwithstanding that I have already declared and written my
mind to his Majesty plainly, with my own hand.</p>

<p>“After this, we told her at good length, how the King’s
Majesty, having used all the gentle means and exhortations
that he might, to have reduced her to the rights of religion
and order of Divine Service set forth by the laws of the
realm, and finding her nothing conformable, but still remaining
in her former error, had resolved, by the whole
estate of his Majesty’s Privy Council, and with the consent
of divers others of the nobility, that she should no longer
use the private Mass, nor any other Divine Service than is
set forth by the laws of the realm; and here we offered to
show her the names of all those that were present at this
consultation and resolution; but she said she cared not for
any rehearsal of their names, for (said she) I know you be
all of one sort therein. We told her further, that the King’s
Majesty’s pleasure was, that we should also give strait
charge to her chaplains and servants, that none of them
should presume to say any Mass or other Divine Service than
is set forth by the laws of the realm, and like charge to all
her servants that none of them should presume to hear any
Mass or other Divine Service than is aforesaid. Hereunto
her answer was this: First, she protested that to the King’s
Majesty she was, is, and ever will be, his most humble and most
obedient subject and poor sister, and would most willingly
obey all his commandments in anything (her conscience
saved)—yea and would willingly and gladly suffer death, to
do his Majesty good; but rather than she will agree to use
any other service than was used at the death of the late
King, her father, she would lay her head on a block and
suffer death; but (said she) I am unworthy to suffer death
in so good a quarrel. When the King’s Majesty (said she)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
shall come to such years that he may be able to judge these
things himself, his Majesty shall find me ready to obey his
orders in religion; but now in these years, although he, good,
sweet King, have more knowledge than any other of his
years, yet is it not possible that he can be a judge in these
things. For if ships were to be sent to the seas, or any other
thing to be done, touching the policy of the government of
the realm, I am sure you would not think his Highness yet
able to consider what were to be done, and much less (said
she) can he in these days discern what is fittest in matters
of divinity. And if my chaplains do say no Mass, I can hear
none, no more can my poor servants, but as for my servants,
I know it shall be against their wills, as it shall be against
mine, for if they could come where it were said, they would
hear it with good-will. And as for my priests, they know
what they have to do. The pain of your laws is but imprisonment
for a short time, and if they will refuse to say Mass
for fear of that imprisonment, they may do therein as they
will, but none of your new service (said she) shall be used
in my house, and if any be said in it, I will not tarry in the
house.”</p>

<p>They then went on to blame Rochester and the others for
not executing the orders of the Council, upon which Mary
replied that “it was not the wisest counsel to appoint her
servants to control her in her own house, and if they refused
to do the message unto her and her chaplains and servants as
aforesaid, they be (said she) the honester men, for they should
have spoken against their own consciences”.</p>

<p>The promise to the Emperor was then discussed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>
<p>“I have (quoth she) the Emperor’s hand, testifying that
this promise was made, which I believe better than you all of
the Council; and though you esteem little the Emperor, yet
should you show more favour to me for my father’s sake, who
made the more part of you, almost of nothing. But as for the
Emperor (said she), if he were dead I would say as I do, and
if he would give me now other advice, I would not follow it,
notwithstanding (quoth she) to be plain with you, his ambassador
shall know how I am used at your hands. After this
we opened the King’s Majesty’s pleasure, for one to attend on
her Grace for the supply of Rochester’s place during his absence.
To this her answer was that she would appoint her own officers,
and that she had years sufficient for that purpose, and if we
left any such man she would go out of her gates, for they two
would not dwell in one house. And (quoth she) I am sickly,
and yet I would not die willingly, but will do the best I can to
preserve my life; but if I shall chance to die, I will protest
openly that you of the Council be the causes of my death; you
give me fair words, but your deeds be always ill towards me.
And having said this, she departed from us into her bedchamber,
and delivered to me, the Lord Chancellor a ring, upon her
knees, most humbly, with very humble recommendations, saying
that she would die his true subject and sister, and obey his
commandments in all things, except in this matter of religion,
touching the Mass and the new Service, but yet said she
this shall never be told to the King’s Majesty. After her
departing, we called the chaplains, and the rest of the household
before us, giving them strait commandment upon pain
of their allegiance, that neither the priests should from henceforth
say any Mass or other Divine Service than that which is
set forth by the laws of the realm, nor that they the residue
of the servants should presume to hear any. The chaplains
after some talk, promised all to obey the King’s Majesty’s
commandment signified by us.”</p>

<p>Each one was ordered on his allegiance, to inform the
Council if this command were disobeyed, and when after
some time, the commissioners were waiting outside the house
for one of the chaplains who had not been present when the
charge was given, they go on to say that, “the Lady Mary’s
Grace sent to us to speak with her one word at a window.
When we were come into the court, notwithstanding that we
offered to come up to her chamber, she would needs speak
out of the window, and prayed us to speak to the Lords of the
Council, that her comptroller might shortly return, for said she
sythens his departing I take the account myself of my expenses,
and learn how many loaves of bread be made of a bushel of
wheat, and ye wis my father and my mother never brought me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
up with baking and brewing, and to be plain with you, I am
weary of mine office, and therefore, if my Lords will send my
officer home, they shall do me pleasure, otherwise if they will
send him to prison, I beshrew him if he go not to it merrily,
and with a good-will. And I pray God to send you to do well
in your souls and bodies too, for some of you have but weak
bodies.”<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281"
class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Instead of granting this last request, the Council committed
the three officers, Rochester, Waldegrave and Inglefield to the
Tower, where they remained till the 18th March 1552, and
a month later, the same Lords addressed letters to the Lady
Mary’s Grace, that her servants be sent unto her according to
her desire. By that time, another wave had swept over Mary’s
destiny. For some reason that has never been apparent, the
King’s counsellors changed their tactics, and the Princess was
henceforth allowed to practise her religion in peace. Edward’s
health was rapidly declining, and the bold design of the Duke
of Northumberland to set aside her rights, and annul her
father’s will, had not yet been framed. It might, therefore,
have been judged prudent, somewhat to conciliate one who
stood so near the throne, and who might soon be called upon
to mount it. Moreover, in 1550, Sir John Masone informed
the Council that the Emperor had serious thoughts of carrying
her off, and in 1551 we find that certain pinnaces were prepared
for her secret transport over sea.<a name="FNanchor_282_282"
id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps both these considerations weighed with the Council,
and the fall of Somerset further turned the scale in her favour
by ridding Mary of her bitterest enemy. He was again arrested
in December 1551, lodged in the Tower, and tried for high
treason. Acquitted of this charge, he was condemned for
felony, and executed within six weeks. The fact is notified in
Edward’s Journal in the words: “The Duke of Somerset had
his head cut off upon Tower hill, between eight and nine o’clock
in the morning” (22nd January 1552).</p>

<p>None of Edward’s ministers had been so violently opposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to the old religion, so active in the advancement of the Reformation
as Somerset. Calvin wrote to him from Geneva,
a letter in which he praised the spiritual work done by the
Protector in England, and gave him sundry advice as to the
disposal of matters in the Church, thanking him for having
presented his works to the young King, and for having taken
into his service a boy whom he had recommended.<a name="FNanchor_283_283"
id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> It was
not likely that a man whose doings were singled out for approval
by Calvin would ever tolerate Mary’s attitude towards
Popery, and therefore his fall may be considered a factor in
the liberty granted to her. Henceforth, to the end of the reign,
she was on good terms with her brother’s ministers, and her
name only occurs in the minutes of the Privy Council Registers
in reference to warrants for payments to her comptroller, Mr.
Rochester, for the maintenance of her household, or for the
repairing of her lands “damaged by the rage of the water this
last year”. One entry mentions the committal of a man “for
stealing the Lady Mary’s hawks”.</p>

<p>An account of a visit paid to her at Hunsdon, in September
1552 by Bishop Ridley shows the complete religious freedom
which she then enjoyed. She received him courteously, and
talked with him very pleasantly for a quarter of an hour,
reminding him that she knew him at court, when he was
chaplain to her father; and she mentioned a sermon which
he had preached at a certain wedding. Then she dismissed
him to dine with her household. After dinner, he offered to
preach to her in the church, on which she replied, that he
might preach, but that neither she nor any of hers would
listen.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he expostulated, “I trust you will not refuse
God’s Word.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell what ye call God’s Word,” answered
Mary. “That is not God’s Word now which was God’s
Word in my father’s days.”</p>

<p>“God’s Word is all one in all times, but is better understood
and practised in some ages than in others,” replied
Ridley.</p>

<p>“You durst not for your ears have avouched that for God’s
Word in my father’s days that now do you,” she retorted,
“and as for your new books, I thank God I never read any
of them; I never did nor ever will do.”</p>

<p>In dismissing him she said, “My lord, for your gentleness
to come and see me, I thank you; but for your offering to
preach before me I thank you never a whit”.</p>

<p>Before leaving, he drank according to custom a stoup of
wine with Mary’s steward, but suddenly felt a qualm of
conscience, and exclaimed, “I have done amiss. I have
drunk in that place where God’s Word offered hath been refused.
I ought, if I had done my duty, to have departed
immediately, and to have shaken the dust off my shoes for
a testimony against this house.”<a name="FNanchor_284_284"
id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Although the Puritans had set the fashion of sober colours
and rigid simplicity of dress, which was followed by most
people during Edward’s reign, the Princess and her friends
continued to assume a considerable amount of state in their
retinue and attire. Strype<a name="FNanchor_285_285"
id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285"
class="fnanchor">[285]</a> records that on her going to
court in 1550, Mary rode through London with fifty knights
and gentlemen in velvet coats and chains of gold before her,
while following her were fourscore gentlemen and ladies. On
her arrival, the Comptroller of the King’s Household received
her, and many lords and knights escorted her through the
hall to the presence chamber, where she remained two hours
“being treated at a goodly banquet”. But when she visited
the King at Greenwich in 1552, it was observed that her
company was only half the number which a nobleman chose
to come with a week afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_286_286"
id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Edward had always been a delicate boy, and his weak
constitution was still further debilitated in 1552, by a combination
of diseases, so that even the most hopeful began
to fear the worst. Nothing was however done to alter
the succession till the spring of the following year. In
May, took place the marriage of Lord Guildford Dudley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
fourth son of the Duke of Northumberland, to the Lady
Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII.’s sister Mary,
who, first married to the King of France, became afterwards
the wife of Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. This marriage
of his son to one so nearly related to the royal family
was Northumberland’s first step in what Turner calls
“that nefarious combination,” by which the Crown was to
be alienated from its rightful possessor, and placed on the
head of a usurper. The injustice of the proceeding was
threefold: 1. Henry VIII. had determined the succession by
virtue of a statute of the realm, and it could not legally be
set aside. 2. In the event of the failure of both his daughters,
the next in succession would have been Mary Stuart, but
Northumberland passed her over with the inconsistent pretext,
that Henry had excluded the issue of his elder sister,
Margaret, from his will. 3. The Lady Frances, daughter of
the Duchess of Suffolk, married to Henry, Lord Grey, created
Duke of Suffolk, was also set aside, in favour of her eldest
daughter, the better to satisfy Northumberland’s ambition
by marrying this young lady to his son. On the 25th June
Edward was so ill that it was reported he was dead, and one
of his physicians told the French ambassador that he could
not get beyond the month of August. He died on the 6th
July, having been persuaded to exclude both his sisters from
the succession, in defiance of his father’s will, and to leave the
Crown to the Lady Jane Grey.</p>

“And when the Lady Mary his sister (who ever kept her house in very
Catholic manner and order) came to visit him, he took special content in her
company (I have heard it from an eye witness) he would ask her many questions,
promise her secrecy, carrying her that respect and reverence, as if she had been
his mother. And she again in her discretion, advised him in some things that
concerned himself, and in other things that touched herself; in all shewing
great affection and sisterly care of him. The young king would burst forth in
tears, grieving matters could not be according to her will and desire. And when
the duke his uncle did use her with straitness and want of liberty, he besought
her to have patience until he had more years, and then he would remedy all.
When she was to take leave, he seemed to part from her with sorrow; he
kissed her, he called for some jewel to present her, he complained that they
gave him no better to give her. Which noted by his tutors, order was taken
that these visits should be very rare, alleging that they made the king sad and
melancholy; and consulted to have afflicted her officer and servants; for that
contrary to the then made law, she had public Mass in her chapel, if they could
draw any consent from the king. But he, upon no reasons, would ever give
way to it, and commanded strictly that she might have full liberty of what she
would. He sent to her, inquiring if they gave her any trouble or molestation,
for if they did, it was against his will, and he would see her contented. But
it was not safe, nor did it stand with prudence, as the times went, for the
Lady Mary to complain” (<i>The Life of Jane Dormer, Duchess of Feria</i>, pp. 61-62).</p></div>

Ridley ordered the altars in his diocese to be taken down, as occasions of
great superstition and error; and tables to be set in their room, in some convenient
place in the chancel or choir. The Catholics ridiculed the tables as

</div>

<p class="ac noindent">THE COMING OF THE QUEEN.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">1553.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hereditary enmity between Charles V. and the King of
France, which in its earliest stages had deluged Europe with
blood, and had made of the city of Rome a shambles, was in
its later developments the cause of most of the troubles of
Mary’s reign. Scarcely was it whispered that Edward lay
dying, when England became at once the political battlefield
of their conflicting interests.</p>

<p>Charles opened the campaign by sending over from Brussels
three envoys extraordinary, ostensibly to visit the King, but
really to watch Mary’s case in the interest of the empire.
These envoys were Jean de Montmorency Sieur de Corrières,
Jacques de Mornix Sieur de Toulouse, and last, though by no
means the least, Simon Renard, who was destined to play an
important part in Mary’s future. France too was immediately
in the field, and Henry II. despatched two envoys to the
coast, with instructions to remain at Boulogne till further
orders, while de Noailles, his ambassador in England, made
overtures to Northumberland of French aid in the event of
foreigners attempting to disturb the tranquillity of the realm.</p>

<p>Charles’s aim was to bring about a marriage between his
son and his cousin, as soon as Mary might be sure of reigning,
in the hope that their issue would exclude the next legitimate
heir to the throne of England, the young Scottish Queen already
betrothed to the Dauphin. On the other hand, Henry’s
object was of course to defeat this project, to prevent Mary
Tudor if possible from succeeding to her inheritance, to
place obstacles in the way of any marriage that might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
proposed, and above all to hinder by every means in his power,
her union with the Prince of Spain.</p>

<p>Mary was no politician. The diplomacy under which she
had suffered had not taught her to meet treachery with dissimulation
and fraud with cunning. She could arm herself
at all points for defence, but she was not a good dissembler.
“To be plain with you,” was an expression natural to her, and
all her words and actions were plain, clean-cut and unmistakable.
Her letters are a distinct contrast to Elizabeth’s monuments
of mystification, framed to confuse, if not altogether to
mislead. Perhaps Mary’s greatest misfortune was that she was
born fifty years too late. Her virtues and her faults were
those of a past, or rapidly passing, age. She belonged by
every fibre of her nature to the old order, while the world
about her was holding out eager arms to the Renaissance, to
the new life that was so well worth living, the new learning
that added a fresh impetus to intellectual pursuits, to the
new religion that was to lead men away from the purgative
into the illuminative way, abolishing good works as snares of
the Evil One. The world was advancing; Mary with a few
kindred spirits was reactionary, and if for a while, her
popularity was as great, the nation’s love for her as enthusiastic
as ever, it was because people were still more than half
unconscious of the new forces at work among them. England
was not yet Protestantised. The legislation of five or six
years had not overcome the habits of thought formed by
nine centuries, and although a new generation had sprung
up since the rupture with Rome, believing that Pope spelt
arch-enemy, the greater number of Englishmen were in all
other respects Catholics by choice. But as strong as their
particular fear of Rome was their general distrust of all
foreigners, and especially of Spaniards; and the French
ambassador took care to keep that distrust alive, and to
increase it by every means in his power.</p>

<p>Edward lay dying, but no sign was allowed to transpire of
the revolution that was intended. The Council Registers are
a blank, save for significant entries concerning the removal of
artillery from the ships and forts to the Tower. But these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
ominous if silent preparations did not escape the notice of the
imperial envoys, who kept close watch, to prevent a surprise.</p>

<p>The young King breathed his last on the evening of the
6th July, but it had been arranged that the event should be
kept secret, till all was in readiness for the great stroke. The
guards were doubled in the palace, and every care was taken
that the outer world should still ask anxiously for news from
the sick chamber. Nevertheless, that same night, Mary was
informed of her brother’s death. She had ridden from
Hunsdon, where she was then residing, towards London, and
was expected by the conspirators at court, whence she would
have been at once transferred in safe custody to the Tower.</p>

<p>At Hoddesden, however, she was met by a secret
messenger, bringing the fateful news. Putting spurs to her
horse, she rode into the eastern counties, with the intention of
gaining Kenninghall, a house in Norfolk left to her by Henry
VIII., the gift being confirmed by a grant of the second year
of Edward VI. On the way, she stopped to rest at the house
of Mr. Huddleston of Sawston, and in consequence of her
prompt action, while she was under this hospitable roof, the
bubble blown by Northumberland burst sooner than had been
intended. On leaving Sawston, Mary looked back from the
summit of a neighbouring hill, and saw smoke rising from
the house that had sheltered her. The rebels had set fire
to it, thinking that she was still there. It was burned to
the ground, but after the rebellion, the Queen granted to
Mr. Huddleston the materials from the ruins of Cambridge
Castle, with which to rebuild his home.<a name="FNanchor_287_287"
id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> Hengrave Hall was
the next halting-place, whence John Bourchier, Earl of Bath,
accompanied her with a considerable force to Kenninghall.

id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
From thence, she sent proclamations into all parts of the
country, announcing her accession, and calling her loyal
subjects to her aid. Among the muniments of Condover
Hall, Shropshire, is a letter from Mary dated six days after
Edward’s death, and addressed to the Mayor of Chester,
summoning the inhabitants of that part of the county to raise
as great a force as possible, and repair to her at Kenninghall,
or elsewhere in Norfolk, “wherefore right trusty and well-beloved,
as ye be true Englishmen, fail ye not”.</p>

<p>With her were the Earl of Sussex, the Lord Mordaunt,
Sir William Drury, Sir John Shelton, Sir Henry Bedingfeld,
Sir Henry Jerningham, besides the Earl of Bath and his
contingent. As her whereabouts became known, numbers
flocked to her standard. In two days, she found herself at
the head of 30,000 men, and while the conspirators were
taking possession of the Tower, of the Crown, of the Crown
jewels and the revenues, Mary without a single accessory of
royalty, without arms or money, was gathering round her
the flower of the nobility, and was issuing manifestoes to
the whole kingdom, as calmly as if she were already undisputed
mistress of the realm. When it became known
that the Duke of Northumberland was advancing with an
army, she removed her quarters to Framlingham, a strongly
fortified house belonging to the Duke of Norfolk, who had
been a prisoner in the Tower ever since 1546.<a name="FNanchor_289_289"
id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> A report was
circulated that the Council was about to execute him, together
with the rest of the State prisoners, Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester,
deprived for religion, and Edward Courtenay, son of
the Marquis of Exeter who was beheaded in the same cause
in 1538.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290"
class="fnanchor">[290]</a> On the 10th July, Jane was proclaimed Queen.</p>

<p>“Item the x. day of the same month, after vii. o’clock at
night was made a proclamation at the Cross in Cheap by
three herolds and one trumpet, with the King’s Sheriff of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
London, Master Garrard, with divers of the guards, for Jane,
the Duke of Suffolk’s daughter to be Queen of England (but
few or none said ‘God save her’) the which was brought the
same afternoon from Richmond unto Westminster, and so
unto the Tower of London by water.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291"
id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> At the same time,
the Lady Mary and the Lady Elizabeth were declared illegitimate,
and all estates and degrees were called upon to be
obedient to their lawful sovereign, Queen Jane. A vintner’s
boy in the crowd ventured to protest against the usurpation,
and for his temerity was nailed to the pillory by the ears,
both of which were amputated before he could be set free.<a name="FNanchor_292_292"
id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the demise of the Crown had been
announced in London, and when the Lady Jane arrived at
the Tower, she was surrounded with as much state as was
possible. The Lord Treasurer presented her ceremoniously
with the Crown; all knelt as she passed by; her train was
carried by her mother, the Duchess of Suffolk. But the space at
the disposal of the new court was extremely limited, the Tower
being crowded with prisoners, as well as with the members of
the new government, who were all lodged there for safety.</p>

<p>In spite of the lack of enthusiasm, and the silence with
which Jane was received, even in Protestant London, the
imperial ambassadors thought Mary’s determined attitude
“strange, difficult and dangerous,” fearing that in four days
she would be in the hands of the Council. Though the
people hated Northumberland for his ambition, and dreaded
him for his tyranny, and though they gave credit to the
rumours that Edward had been poisoned,<a name="FNanchor_293_293"
id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> even Mary’s friends
were of the opinion that it would be necessary to appeal to
the Emperor to place her on the throne. This, the ambassadors
thought, would in no wise diminish the affection of
the country for her, so entirely was she beloved by the people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220"

id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
Their view of the desperate character of her resistance was
strengthened by the information that Northumberland had
sent his son Lord Henry Dudley into France, to solicit
troops, and that 6000 French soldiers were expected shortly
to embark at Dieppe and Boulogne.</p>

<p>On the 11th, a letter from Mary, addressed to the Lords of
the Council was brought to the Tower. It ran as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My Lords</span>,</p>

<p>“We greet you well, and have received sure advertisement
that our dearest brother the King, our late sovereign
lord, is departed to God’s mercy; which news, how
woeful they be unto our heart, he only knoweth, to whose will
and pleasure, we must and do, humbly submit us and our wills.
But in this so lamentable a case, that is to wit, now after his
Majesty’s departure and death, concerning the crown and
governance of this realm of England, with the title of France,
and all things thereto belonging, what hath been provided by
act of Parliament, and the testament and last will of our dearest
father, beside other circumstances advancing our right,
you know, the realm and the whole world knoweth; the rolls
and records appear by the authority of the King our said
father, and the King our said brother, and the subjects of this
realm; so that we verily trust that there is no true good subject
that is, can or would pretend to be, ignorant thereof.
And of our part we have of ourselves caused, and as God shall
aid and strengthen us, shall cause, our right and title in this
behalf to be published and proclaimed accordingly. And
albeit this so weighty a matter seemeth strange, that our said
brother, dying upon Thursday at night last past, we hitherto
had no knowledge from you thereof, yet we consider your
wisdom and prudence to be such, that having eftsoons amongst
you debated, pondered, and well weighed this present case
with our estate, with your own estate, the commonwealth and
all our honours, we shall and may conceive great hope and
trust, with much assurance in your loyalty and service; and
therefore for the time, interpret and take things not to the
worst; and that ye will like noblemen work the best. Nevertheless,
we are not ignorant of your consultations to undo the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
provisions made for our preferment, nor of the great bands and
provisions forcible, wherewith ye be assembled and prepared,
by whom, and to what end, God and you know, and nature
can but fear some evil. But be it that some consideration
politic, or whatsoever thing else hath moved you thereto; yet
doubt you not my lords, but we can take all these your doings
in gracious part, being also right ready to remit and fully
pardon the same, and that freely, to eschew bloodshed and
vengeance against all those that can or will intend the same;
trusting also assuredly, you will take and accept this grace
and virtue in good part, as appertaineth, and that we shall not
be enforced to use the service of other our true subjects and
friends, which in this our just and right cause, God, in whom
our whole affiance is, shall send us. Wherefore my lords, we
require you and charge you, and every of you, that of your
allegiance, which you owe to God and us, and to none other,
for our honour, and the surety of our person, only employ
yourselves, and forthwith, upon receipt hereof, cause our right
and title to the crown and governance of this realm to be
proclaimed in our city of London, and other places, as to your
wisdom shall seem good, and as to this case appertaineth; not
failing hereof, as our very trust is in you. And this our letter
signed with our hand, shall be your sufficient warrant in this
behalf.</p>

<p>“Given under our signet at our manor of Kenninghall,
the 9th of July 1553.”</p></div>

<p>This display of courage made no impression on the conspirators,
and they made answer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>“We have received your letters the 9th of this
instant, declaring your supposed title, which you judge yourself
to have, to the imperial crown of this realm, and all the
dominions thereunto belonging. For answer whereof, this is
to advertise you, that for as much as our sovereign lady queen
Jane is after the death of our sovereign lord Edward the 6th, a
prince of most noble memory, invested and possessed with the
just and right title in the imperial crown of this realm, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
only by good order of old ancient laws of this realm, but also
by our late sovereign lord’s letters patent, signed with his
own hand, and sealed with the great Seal of England, in presence
of the most part of the nobles, councillors, judges, with
divers other grave and sage personages, assenting and subscribing
to the same. We must therefore of most bound duty
and allegiance assent unto her said grace, and to none other,
except we should, which faithful subjects cannot, fall into
grievous and unspeakable enormities. Wherefore we can no
less do, but for the quiet both of the realm and you also, to
advertise you, that forasmuch as the divorce made between
the King of famous memory Henry 8th and the lady Katherine,
your mother, was necessary to be had, both by the everlasting
laws of God, and also by the ecclesiastical laws, and by
the most part of the noble and learned universities of Christendom,
and confirmed also by the sundry acts of Parliament,
remaining yet in their force, and thereby you justly made
illegitimate and unheritable to the crown imperial of this
realm, and the rules and dominions, and possessions of the
same, you will, upon just consideration hereof, and of divers
other causes lawful to be alleged for the same, and for the just
inheritance of the right line and godly order, taken by the late
King our sovereign lord King Edward the 6th, and agreed upon
by the nobles and great personages aforesaid, surcease by any
pretence, to vex and molest any of our sovereign lady Queen
Jane her subjects, from their true faith and allegiance unto her
grace: assuring you, that if you will for respect, show yourself
quiet and obedient, as you ought, you shall find us all and
several ready to do you any service that we with duty may,
and be glad with your quietness, to preserve the common state
of this realm: wherein you may be otherwise grievous unto us,
to yourself and to them. And thus we bid you most heartily
well to fare.</p>

<p>“From the Tower of London, in this 9th July 1553.</p>

<p>“Your ladyship’s friends, showing yourself an obedient
subject.”</p></div>

<p>Then follow the signatures of all the members of the
Council, thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thomas Canterbury, the Marquis of Winchester, John
Bedford, Will. Northampton, Thomas Ely, chancellor; Northumberland,
Henry Suffolk, Henry Arundel, Shrewsbury,
Pembroke, Cobham, R. Rich, Huntingdon, Darcy, Cheney,
R. Cotton, John Gates, W. Peter, W. Cecill, John Cheeke,
John Mason, Edward North, R. Bowes”.<a name="FNanchor_295_295"
id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p>The confident tone of the above letter concealed the real
sentiments of the conspirators. The Duke of Suffolk had
been commissioned by Northumberland to march into
Norfolk, seize Mary’s person, and bring her a prisoner to
London. But Jane besought her father with tears not
to leave her, and Northumberland reluctantly took the
command of the rebel troops himself. As they marched
through Shoreditch, he observed to Sir John Gates, “The
people crowd to look upon us, but not one exclaims God
speed ye!”<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296"
class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>He had no illusions about the attitude of the citizens,
and trusted more to an eloquent and fiery appeal to their
Protestantism, than to the hope of overawing them with the
shadow of a sovereignty, for which they evinced undisguised
contempt. Before leaving London, therefore, he charged the
ministers of religion to expatiate in their sermons on the
benefits to be derived from the reign of a Protestant queen,
and thus work on their religious feelings. Ridley, Bishop of
London, was the preacher at Paul’s Cross on the 16th July.
He declaimed violently against Mary, and sought to persuade
his hearers that she would bring in foreign power, and subvert
all Christian religion already established. He stigmatised her
religion as a “popish creed,” and herself as “the idolatrous
rival” of Queen Jane. He related the story of his visit to
her at Hunsdon, and remarked on the significance of her refusal
to listen to his preaching, adding that “notwithstanding
in all other points of civility, she showed herself gentle and
tractable, yet in matters that concerned truth, faith and
doctrine—so stiff and obstinate that there was no other hope
of her to be conceived, but to disturb and overturn all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
which with so great labours had been confirmed and planted
by her brother afore”.<a name="FNanchor_297_297"
id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>The people listened in unwonted and unsympathetic
silence. They had not yet learned to associate the claims
of inheritance with those of religious convictions. It would
have seemed to them preposterous, that Mary should forfeit
her right to reign, because she professed the religion practised
by every one of her predecessors, with the single exception
of Edward, who had died before escaping from tutelage.
Ridley’s language was reported seditious, and when, after
Mary’s proclamation, the Bishop of London hastened to
Framlingham to stultify all that he had said, by laying his
homage at the Queen’s feet, he was arrested at Ipswich,
deprived of his dignities, and sent to the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_298_298"
id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of Northumberland, meanwhile, reached Bury
with an army of 8,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, only to find
that he had been declared a rebel, and that a price had been
put upon his head. He would have pushed on towards
Framlingham, but disheartened by the hourly desertion of
his followers to Mary’s standard, he ordered a retreat to
Cambridge. Six ships, fully armed and manned, had been
sent to lie in wait off Yarmouth, in order to intercept Mary
should she attempt to fly the realm. Sir Henry Jerningham,
who was raising troops in her behalf, boarded them each in
turn, and would have taken their captains prisoners, the whole
of the crews declaring for Mary, and expressing themselves
willing to deliver them up:—</p>

<p>“Then the mariners axed master Gernyngham what he
would have, and whether he would have their captains or
no, and he said ‘yea marry’. Said they ‘ye shall have them,
or else we shall throw them to the bottom of the sea’. The
captains, seeing this perplexity, said forthwith they would
serve Queen Mary gladly, and so came forth with their men,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and conveyed certain great ordinance, of the which coming
in of the ships, the lady Mary and her company were wonderful
joyous, and then afterward doubted greatly the Duke’s
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">puissance</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_299_299"
id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely had Northumberland left the Tower, when the
news was brought that Mary had been proclaimed at Norwich,
that Sir Edward Peckham and Sir Edward Hastings, Lord
Windsor and others were out proclaiming her in Buckinghamshire,
and worst news of all, that the ships had surrendered
instantly to Jerningham. “Each man then,” says
the <i>Chronicle of Queen Jane</i>, “began to pluck in his horns,”
and when a messenger arrived from Oxfordshire, with tidings
that Sir John Williams was holding the county for Mary,
the Earl of Pembroke and Sir Thomas Cheney tried to get
out of the Tower to feel the pulse of London. But Suffolk
kept all the members of the Council in a sort of honourable
captivity,<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300"
class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and the matter required some nice handling. The
Council Registers, which contain no entries relating to the
Lady Jane’s brief reign, certify that on the 16th July, Queen
Mary’s friends in four counties, numbering in all 10,000,
assembled at Paget’s house at Drayton, and marched to
Westminster, where they took possession of the arms and
ammunition stored in the palace, “for the better furnishing
of themselves in the defence of the Queen’s Majesty’s person
and her title”. Money was so scarce that no regular pay
could be given to the soldiers, the captain of each band
being charged to relieve at his own discretion those who
were plainly necessitous, “but in such sort that it appear not
otherwise but to be of his own liberality”.<a name="FNanchor_301_301"
id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p>Paget, it appears from the above, though shut up in the
Tower, was in friendly communication with the loyalists; and
it is evident from Cecil’s own account of his submission, that
the moment Northumberland had left, the various members
of the Council began to plot against him. On the 19th July,
the Lords Treasurer, Privy Seal, Arundel, Shrewsbury and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
Pembroke, with Sir Thomas Cheney and Sir John Masone
succeeded, under pretext of receiving the French ambassador,
in getting out of the Tower, and having communicated with
the Lord Mayor, were at once joined by that dignitary, the
Recorder, and a deputation of aldermen. They assembled
at Baynard’s Castle, and the Earl of Arundel opened the
proceedings by censuring Northumberland’s ambition. As he
finished speaking, Pembroke, drawing his sword, exclaimed:
“If the arguments of my lord Arundel do not persuade
you, this sword shall make Mary queen, or I will die in her
quarrel”. Shouts of applause answered him, and the Duke
of Suffolk, who had been sent for, signed the proclamation.
The summons had convinced him that all was lost, and he
ordered his men to leave their weapons behind them. He
proclaimed Mary on Tower Hill, before joining the other
members of the Council. They then all rode through the
City, and proclaimed her at Paul’s Cross, after which Arundel
and Paget were despatched to lay the submission of the
Council at her feet.<a name="FNanchor_302_302"
id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>According to the <i>Grey Friars’ Chronicle</i>, “The choir sang
<i>Te Deum</i> with the organs going and the bells ringing, as
most parts all. And the same night had the [most] part of
London to dinner, with bonfires in every street of London,
with good cheer at every bonfire; and the bells ringing in
every parish-church, for the most part all night till the
next day to None.”</p>

<p>A newsletter in Ralph Starkey’s collection says, “Great
was the triumph here at London; for my time I never saw
the like, and by the report of others, the like was never seen.
The number of caps that were thrown up at the proclamation
were not to be told. The Earl of Pembroke threw away his
cap full of angellettes. I saw myself, money was thrown out
at windows for joy. The bonfires were without number, and
what with shouting and crying of the people, and ringing
of the bells, there could no one hear almost what another
said, besides banquettings and singing in the street for joy.”<a name="FNanchor_303_303"
id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Even Foxe, Mary’s bitterest enemy, admitted that “God
so turned the hearts of the people to her, and against the
Council, that she overcame them without bloodshed, notwithstanding
there was made great expedition against her
both by sea and land”.<a name="FNanchor_304_304"
id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<p>Jane, having left her apartments in ignorance of what was
happening, to stand sponsor at the baptism of the child of
Edward Underhill in St. John’s Chapel, found on her return
that the cloth of estate, and other insignia of royalty had
disappeared from her presence chamber, by order of the
Duke of Suffolk himself. The Crown had passed for ever
from her, and there was no alternative but a hasty retreat
into that private life, from which it would have been well
for her had she never been drawn.</p>

<p>So much extravagant language has been employed by the
partisans of the Lady Jane Grey, in describing her virtues
and accomplishments, while her youth and tragic end make
her so interesting a figure, that it is scarcely wonderful if we
find it difficult to form a sober opinion of one, who appeared
for a moment in our annals, and as the price of that appearance,
laid her fair young head upon the block. The charm
that failed to draw even a murmur of applause from her
contemporaries, when she was thrust upon them as Queen
has been potent ever since, and there are few who do not
unconsciously canonise her on account of her misfortunes.</p>

<p>She had been educated severely, in the same kind of intellectual
school as that, in which the daughters of Henry VIII.
and the learned family of Sir Thomas More had also distinguished
themselves. She was a good Latin and Greek
scholar, and was further well versed in the doctrines of the
Genevan Reformers. The instrument of Northumberland’s
ambitious schemes, she had passively acquiesced in the
dignity conspired for her, but once raised to the throne, the
timid girl of sixteen had suddenly displayed the obstinacy
which she had inherited from her Tudor grandmother, and
had evinced spirit and determination enough to refuse to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
share her supposed title with her husband.<a name="FNanchor_305_305"
id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> Had the bold
stroke succeeded, which placed the Crown for a moment in
her hands, her father-in-law might have lived to repent his
temerity.</p>

<p>It would be obviously unfair to hold Jane responsible for all
that was done in her name, but although Mary’s temper showed
itself the reverse of vindictive, it must have cost the Queen
an effort, to forgive the nine days’ usurper the letter which
purported to have been written by her to the Marquis of
Northampton, announcing her accession, and requiring his
allegiance and defence of her title, against “the feigned and
untrue claim of the Lady Mary, bastard daughter to our
great-uncle, Henry the Eighth of famous memory”. The
draft of this letter, in Northumberland’s hand, and endorsed
by Cecil “First copy of a letter to be written by the Lady
Jane when she came from the Tower,” is in the British
Museum, as is also the copy made by a clerk and signed
by Jane. This second copy was afterwards endorsed by the
Duke “<i>Jana non Regina</i>”.<a name="FNanchor_306_306"
id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306"
class="fnanchor">[306]</a> On the news reaching the Duke of
Northumberland that the Council had submitted to Mary, and
that immediately the troops had testified their satisfaction in
a volley of artillery, he saw that further resistance would be
suicidal. He threw up his cap and shouted, “Long live
Queen Mary! so laughing that the tears ran down his face
with grief”.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307"
class="fnanchor">[307]</a> In less than an hour, he was summoned to disband
his army, and commanded not to approach London
within ten miles. He remained at Cambridge, and when that
place, following the example of Great Yarmouth, Colchester and
Bury declared for Mary, he was arrested by the municipality, but
released on the Queen’s proclamation, ordering every man to go
to his own home, till further orders. Scarcely however did he
breathe freely, when the Earl of Arundel arrived to apprehend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
him on a charge of high treason. Over and above the guilt which
he shared with the whole Council, he had borne arms against his
lawful sovereign, and was suspected of having offered Calais
to the French as the price of their support. At once guessing
why Arundel had come, he fell on his knees, and with a craven
spirit begged him to be good to him for the love of God.
“And consider,” he added, “I have done nothing but by the
consent of you all, and all the whole Council.” He went to
the Tower, guarded by 4,000 soldiers, and was lodged in the
Beauchamp Tower, whence he wrote abjectly to Arundel:
“Oh that it would please her good Grace to give me life, yea
the life of a dog, if I might live and kiss her feet; and spend
both life and all in her humble service, as I have the best part
already, under her worthy brother and most glorious father”.</p>

<p>Northumberland was, justly enough, the scapegoat; but as
he had said, no member of the Council came out of the matter
with clean hands. All had signed the will which the Duke
had dictated to Edward, enfeebled by his mortal disease, and
dexterously worked up to a pitch of fanaticism that made
him oblivious of justice. But Cecil’s proceedings were, by his
own showing, perhaps the most despicable. In his written
submission<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308"
class="fnanchor">[308]</a> to Queen Mary, after beseeching her clemency, he
went on to confess that his conduct throughout the plot had
been guided by the one consideration of saving his skin whole. He
had shuffled as long as he dared brave the Duke’s irritation,
and had given in only, when the odds in favour of the
conspirators seemed overwhelming. But when Northumberland
had charged him to proclaim the Lady Jane, he had
shifted the responsibility of the act on to Throckmorton,
“whose conscience I saw was troubled therewith, misliking
the matter”. The document ends with the pious invocation:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Justus adjutorium meus Dominus qui salvos facit rectos
corde.</span></i> God save the Queen in all felicity.</p>

<p class="ar">
“<span class="smcap">W. Cecill.</span>”
</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir William Petre had also tried to make compromises
with the Duke, but had succumbed, on being told that unless
he agreed to the whole plan he could no longer retain his
office of Secretary of State. Each day brought Mary fresh
conquests. After a nine days’ rebellion, without a single blow
having been struck in her defence, she was proclaimed Queen
in every town in England. Her journey to London was a
triumphal progress. Antoine de Noailles, the French ambassador,
who had so lately conspired with Edward’s Council, and
who was to be the evil genius of the new reign, rode twenty-five
miles into the country to meet and congratulate the Queen
in his master’s name, offering her the whole of the French
forces, in support of her right. At Wanstead, she was joined
by the Lady Elizabeth, who had prudently abstained from
taking sides, till it should be clear where success lay. She
had declined Northumberland’s overtures, and offers of large
sums of money, but had equally avoided moving a finger in
Mary’s cause, pleading an illness, which however allowed her
to recover opportunely, when the Queen was about to take
possession of her capital. Mary greeted her affectionately,
embraced all her ladies, and assigned her the next place in the
royal cortège after herself.<a name="FNanchor_309_309"
id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309"
class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Together they entered the City
of London at Aldgate, on the 3rd August, and rode through
the densely crowded streets, the multitude rending the air
with shouts of joy. Elizabeth was too clever not to estimate
at its real value the contrast presented by the two sisters on
this striking occasion. In spite of their loyalty and enthusiasm
in realising the reward of their long devotion, the people could
not fail to observe, that the Queen at thirty-seven, worn with
trouble and sickness, was eclipsed by Elizabeth’s twenty years.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was tall and majestic, more gracious than beautiful,
pale of complexion, with fine eyes, and hands that were
admired for their whiteness and elegance. It was noticed that
she knew how to use them effectively.<a name="FNanchor_310_310"
id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Tower, where according to custom, the Queen was
to reside pending her brother’s obsequies, the State prisoners
of the two preceding reigns were kneeling on the Green, in
front of the scaffold. These were the Duchess of Somerset,
who had been in captivity since the execution of her husband;
the aged Duke of Norfolk; Edward Courtenay, son of the
Marquis of Exeter, beheaded in 1538; Tunstal and Gardiner,
the deprived Bishops of Durham and Winchester. Gardiner,
in the name of them all, congratulated Mary on her accession,
and without complaining of the injustice of their detention
expressed their joy at seeing her victorious over her enemies.<a name="FNanchor_311_311"
id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>“Ye are my prisoners!” exclaimed the Queen, bursting into
tears. Embracing them all, she ordered them to be released
at once, and took them with her to the royal apartments.
Their goods, their rank, their sees were restored. The next
day, Gardiner was sworn a member of the Privy Council,
and three weeks later, was made Lord Chancellor of England.</p>

<p>The names of twenty-seven persons concerned in the rebellion
were handed to the Queen. Of these she struck out
sixteen, leaving eleven to be tried. These were again reduced
to seven—the Duke of Northumberland, his son the Earl of
Warwick, the Marquis of Northampton, Sir John Gates, Sir
Henry Gates, Sir Andrew Dudley and Sir Thomas Palmer.
The law then took its course, and they were condemned to
death. But Mary again intervened; four were reprieved, and
three only of the ringleaders, the Duke of Northumberland,
Sir John Gates and Sir Thomas Palmer, his chief advisers,
were executed. The Emperor urged her in vain to include the
Lady Jane in the number of those to be tried for high treason.
The Queen spoke warmly in her defence, and declared that she
was less guilty than he believed her to be. Usurper though
she had been, she was but a tool, and Mary would not have
her punished for another’s crime. She had returned to the
Tower as a prisoner, along with her husband, but was allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
great freedom within its precincts. The danger of her pretensions
was, Mary declared, imaginary, but every precaution
should be taken before she was restored to liberty.<a name="FNanchor_312_312"
id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> With unprecedented
mildness, the Queen had been inclined to pardon
even Northumberland, but Charles put pressure on her to sign
his death-warrant. The Duke made no defence at his trial,
and on the scaffold admitted his crime, expressed penitence,
and declared that he died a member of the Catholic and
Roman Church.<a name="FNanchor_313_313"
id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>Whether Mary was persuaded of Jane’s innocence on the
ground that the girl was scarcely a free agent, or whether
the letter which Jane wrote to her as a prisoner,<a name="FNanchor_314_314"
id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> turned the
balance in her favour, is not clear, but it is certain that the
Queen’s treatment of her rival at this time was magnanimous
to imprudence, as the sequel showed. As for the other delinquents,
no rebellion had ever been quenched with so little
effusion of blood. Far otherwise had been Henry’s reprisals
after the northern rising, far other the crushing of the insurgents
in Edward’s reign. Had the punishment of the rebels
rested entirely with Mary, she would have signalised her
advent with a full and general amnesty. The Duchess of
Suffolk had thrown herself at the Queen’s feet, imploring the
pardon and release of her husband, both of which she obtained
immediately; but strange as it appears, it is not on record
that she even attempted to plead for her daughter.<a name="FNanchor_315_315"
id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>More stringent measures at the outset would no doubt have
averted the serious disturbances of the following year, and
afterwards; and the opinion of Charles V., that to punish the
authors of sedition was to nip the revolution in the bud, was
justified in the event. He had insisted on the execution of
Northumberland and his lieutenants, but more than this he
had not obtained. The people had little respect or gratitude
for a clemency which they did not understand.</p>

“He (Mr. Huddleston) was highly honoured afterwards by Queen Mary,

<p class="ac noindent"><i>July-December</i> 1553.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mary’s</span> opportunity was in many ways a splendid one.
From her earliest youth, the new Queen had been the hope,
the admiration, the delight of the English people, and the
poet expressed no mere conceit in the words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse"><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il n’est cœur si triste qui
	    ne rie</span></i></div>
      <div class="verse"><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En attendant la princesse
	    Marie.</span></i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The whole country welcomed her as one man, and it may be
truly said that it was the affection of Englishmen, no less
than their loyalty that had placed her on the throne. Nevertheless,
she was beset with difficulties. The art of reigning
as she understood it was part and parcel of the mediæval
system, but it needed a spirit touched with the inspiration of
the new age, to direct the restless activities of a nation already
beginning to be permeated with the Renaissance. While she
looked back to the past, her people had emancipated themselves
from mediæval traditions.</p>

<p>Moulding her conduct on the ideals which she had
venerated from her youth upwards, she regarded the new
needs and tendencies with suspicion and dislike; and thus
gradually a breach was formed between herself and the
nation. She had its interests as sincerely at heart as any
English monarch either before or after her, but those interests,
as she understood them, were hopelessly at variance with
the seething crowd of ideas that were transforming the life of
the people.</p>

<p>With intense honesty of purpose, Mary stood at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
parting of the ways, between a mediævalism that seemed
good in her eyes, and a progress that all her experience had
taught her to interpret as revolution. It was partly her
inability to distinguish between the two, to seize the good
element in the new modes of thought, that brought about
the catastrophe of her reign, and evolved anarchy out of
aspirations, which ably led and controlled, might have contributed
to the welfare of the realm. If it is unfortunate to
be born in advance of one’s age, it is doubly so to be behind
it; but if conscientious motives and earnest endeavour could
have compensated for the mistake, Mary would have won
golden opinions instead of hatred and abuse. But there were
difficulties quite independent of her own limitations. At the
outset, the task of forming a government was a delicate one.
Nearly all the statesmen of the time had been members of
Edward’s Council and had proved themselves traitors. When
she had restored the Duke of Norfolk to the Council Board,
had installed Sir John Gage as Constable of the Tower, had
made Sir Henry Jerningham a member of her Privy Council,
Vice-Chancellor and Captain of the Guard, had knighted
her faithful Rochester and set him over her household, had
promoted Waldegrave to the charge of the Grand Wardrobe,
and had made Sir Francis Englefield a Privy Councillor, the
most important of the public offices remained to be filled by
those whom she could neither afford to offend nor to dispense
with, but who had all failed at the critical moment. The
Earl of Arundel became Lord Steward, the Marquis of
Winchester retained his office of High Treasurer, while many
others of doubtful loyalty, including Sir William Petre and
Sir John Masone, made her Privy Council a compact body of
potential conspirators. Lord Paget, the most dangerous of
all, became Secretary of State and Privy Seal. Gardiner,
henceforth Lord Chancellor, had once vehemently opposed
the validity of her mother’s marriage, although he had since
amply vindicated his claim to Mary’s regard, and stood
highest of all in her counsels, a sufficient answer to the
charge so often made that the Queen had foredoomed
Cranmer, because he had pronounced the sentence of divorce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary lost no time in acquainting the Emperor and the
French King with her resolve to bring back Catholic worship.
Henry congratulated her on her intention, and urged her to
proceed at once; but Charles advised caution, and told her
to pause until she had obtained the consent of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_316_316"
id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
From Rome came still other counsel. If Mary was strangely
unconscious of the change that had come over the country
since the days of her childhood, at the heart of Christendom
a still greater optimism prevailed. Reginald Pole wrote to
her, urging not only the reconciliation of her kingdom with
the Holy See, but also the restitution of Church lands. He
congratulated her on the manner of her accession, and trusted
that as she had been tutored in the school of God how
to rule herself, her realm would become a mirror of good
order and true justice, to the comfort of all good men.<a name="FNanchor_317_317"
id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> He
also wrote to the Emperor, representing that as the principal
foundation of her right to the Crown rested on the legitimacy
of her mother’s marriage, which depended on the
Papal dispensation of Julius II.; by deferring the re-establishment
of Papal authority her right was in consequence deferred
also.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318"
class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Again he wrote to Mary herself, drawing attention to her
own spiritual danger and to the shipwrecked condition of the
English nation, “for the Queen, or at least England, was assuredly
shipwrecked, when she threw herself into the sea of
this century; and having drawn a picture of the danger, her
Majesty will judge whether it is the time to deliberate, or
rather to act as ordained and prescribed her by divine and
human counsel”.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319"
class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>Pole was not alone in advising prompt and swift action.
All over the continent the same ignorance prevailed concerning
the fact that England was not the same country as in
the days when Henry VIII. broke away from Rome, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
this mistaken notion as to Mary’s difficulties was not strange,
seeing that the Queen herself was still peacefully unaware of
more than half of them. The Papal nuncio in France, writing
to the Cardinal del Monte, said: “From England comes the
news that the Queen is about to enter London, beloved and
revered by the people, not only as Queen but as a saint. Her
sister has arrived, and her Majesty caused her to be received
most honourably, a thousand horses with green and white
velvet trappings being sent to meet her. All the populace
cry out that Northumberland, Suffolk and Jane should have
their heads cut off. It is believed that they poisoned the late
King. As soon as the Queen arrives in London, it is supposed
that she will have the marriage between her mother and father
declared valid, and she is said to desire it very much, and wills
it to be declared by all Parliaments and statutes, so that her
mother’s and her own honour may be fully satisfied. Another
of her intentions is to re-establish religion under the obedience
of his Holiness, and the feeling of the realm is with her.”
This was all true enough, but to complete the picture, he
should have added that the Puritan Londoners were violently
opposed to the old religion, that Elizabeth was as hostile as
she dared to be, and was already looked on as the champion
of the Protestant party, that the French ambassador played
into their hands, and was ready for any conspiracy.</p>

<p>The advice of the Emperor was preferred to all other.
Next to Mary’s devotion to her faith was her loyalty to the
Hapsburgs. She had grown up in the belief that Charles
was her best friend and only refuge; and now whenever she
considered herself free to choose an independent policy, she
chose to follow his advice. Indeed, it is scarcely thinkable,
that at thirty-seven she should have awoke from the dream
of a lifetime, by the mere fact of ascending the throne.
In many ways, the Emperor advised her well. He had
vast experience of the kind of religious revolution that was
agitating the greater part of Europe. He had been twice
in England, but more perhaps by his genius for government,
and his habit of working out national problems on
paper, than by his actual knowledge of the English people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
the knowledge that comes from contact, did he realise the
amount of pressure that could with any chance of success be
brought to bear upon them. So long as he applied general
principles in his advice to Mary, so long was his guidance of
service to her; but where his own interests were concerned,
and those of the empire, he ceased to consider her advantage
at all, and involved her in a policy that ultimately became
her ruin. If he had so willed, she would have gone to the
block cheerfully for the principles for which More and Fisher
died; but her martyrdom would have availed the Emperor
nothing. Rather would it have embroiled him further with
Henry, whose friendship he was just then anxious to obtain.
Therefore he did not scruple to entangle her conscience in
the meshes of an indefensible sophistry. When Edward’s
Council had brought the country to so miserable a condition
that the Government, neither feared nor respected abroad,
dared not try conclusions with him, it was a small matter for
him to declare that he had rather Mary died on the scaffold
than abandon one jot or tittle of her faith. Having therefore
been the arbiter of her destiny during the years of her
bondage, it was not likely that he would cease to exercise
his influence when the majesty of England was centred in
her person.</p>

<p>Although Mary had wished Edward’s obsequies to be performed
in the Catholic manner, when Charles represented to
her that, as her brother had died professing the new, reformed
religion, she could not consistently have him buried as a
Catholic, she yielded to Cranmer’s objection to having a
Popish Mass said over his body. The Archbishop of Canterbury
therefore conducted his funeral, in accordance with the
established form, in Westminster Abbey, the Queen, at the
same time, with 300 of the nobility assisting at a solemn Dirge
for his soul in St. John’s Chapel in the Tower. Elizabeth
refused to be present at the Mass of requiem,<a name="FNanchor_320_320"
id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and Renard
pressed Mary to take measures against her, declaring that her
profession of Protestantism was a decoy, to attract to herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the malcontents, and to form a party in the State dangerous
to peace and security.<a name="FNanchor_321_321"
id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321"
class="fnanchor">[321]</a> After events proved the truth of this
opinion. Mary replied that she was thinking of sending her
sister away from the court; but, meanwhile, Elizabeth still
remained, and the Queen did her best to convert her.</p>

<p>The bulk of the nation heartily welcomed the return of
the old worship, but London was Protestant to the backbone.
Something like a riot took place on the occasion of an unauthorised
celebration of Mass, in a church near the Horse-market,
and when Gilbert Bourne, Archdeacon of St. Paul’s,
attempted to preach at Paul’s Cross on the 13th August fresh
disturbances arose. The occasion was unfortunate, his theme
dealing with the unjust imprisonment of Bonner; and the
preacher’s language became somewhat inflammatory. “In
this very place, upon this very day, four years afore passed,”
cried Bourne, “was the Bishop of London, who is here present,
most unjustly cast into the vile dungeon of the Marshalsea,
among thieves.”<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322"
class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Bonner was hated by the Londoners on
account of his uncompromising Papistry, and for what they
considered his want of tact, in his conduct towards Ridley,
who had been intruded into his see, when Edward deprived
him for religion, and whom he now replaced. The sight of
him, as he sat listening to Bourne’s panegyric, incensed the
partisans of Ridley. As the preacher went on, low murmurs
grew into fierce cries, and at last a voice called out, “Pull him
down!” A dagger was thrown at Bourne, hit a post of the
pulpit, and rebounded a great way. With difficulty Bourne
was conveyed to a place of safety in St. Paul’s School.<a name="FNanchor_323_323"
id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
following Sunday, a detachment of the Queen’s guard was sent
to protect the preacher,<a name="FNanchor_324_324"
id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324"
class="fnanchor">[324]</a> but after this event, few came to listen
to the discourses at Paul’s Cross, and the Lord Mayor was
ordered “to make the ancients of the companies resort to the
sermons, lest the preacher should be discouraged by a small
audience”.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325"
class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p>These riots produced the first tightening of the reins of
government, a measure which only led to further irritation.
A royal proclamation was issued, which although testifying
to Mary’s benignity, describes the tumultuous state of the
metropolis. A part of it ran thus:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> “First, her Majesty being
presently, by the only goodness of God, settled in her just
possession of the imperial crown of this realm, and other
dominions thereunto belonging, cannot now hide that religion
which God and the world knoweth she hath ever professed
from her infancy hitherto: which as her Majesty is minded to
observe and maintain for herself, by God’s grace, during her
time, so doth her Highness much desire and would be glad
the same were of all her subjects quietly and charitably embraced.
And yet she doth signify unto all her Majesty’s
loving subjects, that of her most gracious disposition and
clemency, her Highness mindeth not to compel any her said
subjects thereunto, unto such time as further order, by common
assent may be taken therein: forbidding nevertheless all her
subjects of all degrees, at their perils to move seditions or stir
unquietness in her people, by interpreting the laws of this
realm after their brains and fantasies, but quietly to continue
for the time till (as before is said) further order may be taken;
and therefore willeth and straitly chargeth and commandeth
all her said good loving subjects, to live together in quiet sort
and christian charity, leaving those new found devilish terms of
papist or heretic and such like, and applying their whole care,
study and travail to live in the fear of God, exercising their
conversations in such charitable and godly doing, as their lives
may indeed express that great hunger and thirst of God’s
glory and holy word, which by rash talk and words many have
pretended; and in so doing they shall best please God, and
live without danger of the laws, and maintain the tranquillity
of the realm,” etc., etc.<a name="FNanchor_326_326"
id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>This was published on the 18th August, but scarcely succeeded
in quieting men’s minds. Unauthorised Masses were
constantly being said in prominent places of worship hitherto
given over to the services of the established religion. Machyn’s
<i>Diary</i> records the fact that on “the xxiii day of August began
the mass at Saint Nicholas Colabay, goodly sung in Latin,
and tapers and set on the altar, and a cross, in old Fish Street.
Item the next day a goodly mass sung at St. Nicholas
Wyllms, in Latin, in Bread Street.”<a name="FNanchor_327_327"
id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>To many, these things appeared quite otherwise than
“goodly,” and there was much murmuring at street corners
and in taverns, angry discussions that might easily end in
brawls; and the forbidden words “papist” and “heretic” were
bandied about without much restraint. Consequently, every
householder was exhorted to “keep his children, apprentices
and other servants in such order and awe, as they follow their
work the week days, and keep their parish-churches the holy
day, and otherwise to be suffered to attempt nothing tending
to the violation of common peace, and that for the contrary,
every one of them to stand charged for his children and
servants”.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all eyes were fixed on Cranmer. It is more
than probable, that if he had remained quiescent he would
have been suffered to retire into private life, or to betake himself
to the continent like so many others of his opinions.
Strype says that he was called before the Council at the beginning
of August, to answer for his share in the late rebellion;
that he was severely reprimanded, and ordered to confine
himself to his palace at Lambeth. But this statement is unsupported
by any evidence. There are no minutes of the
Privy Council between the 2nd and the 8th August, on which
day Edward’s funeral took place, when certainly Cranmer was
not a prisoner either on parole or otherwise. Strype seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
to have been confused by a letter from the Archbishop to
Cecil, dated 14th August, in which he says that he has been
to court. This appearance in the Queen’s presence would
account for the report that was immediately circulated, to the
effect that he had pledged himself to Mary, to say Mass for
her.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328"
class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Disagreeable as the rumour must have been to him in
his position as reformer, worse was to follow. Mass had once
more been said in Canterbury Cathedral, and Cranmer was
accredited by the public voice with having said it. This was
more than he could endure, and fired with indignation, he
took the first irrevocable step towards his doom. Seizing his
pen, he wrote the celebrated <i>Declaration</i> which, if the Archbishop
of Canterbury has any determining voice in the doctrine
of the Established Church of England, should for ever
settle the question whether that Church teaches belief in the
Sacrifice of the Mass or not.</p>

<p>“As the devil, Christ’s ancient adversary is a liar and the
father of lies, even so hath he stirred up his servants and
members to persecute Christ, and his true word and religion,
which he ceaseth not to do most earnestly at this present.
For whereas the most noble Prince of famous memory, King
Henry VIII., seeing the great abuses of the Latin masses,
reformed something herein, in his time; and also our late
sovereign Lord, King Edward VI. took the same whole away,
for the manifold errors and abuses thereof, and restored in
the place thereof, Christ’s holy Supper, according to Christ’s
own institution, and as the apostles in the primitive church
used the same in the beginning, the devil goeth about by
lying, to overthrow the Lord’s holy Supper, and to restore the
Latin satisfactory masses, a thing of his own invention and
device. And to bring the same more easily to pass, some have
abused the name of me Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury,
bruiting abroad that I have set up the mass at Canterbury,
and that I offered to say mass before the Queen’s Highness,
and at Paul’s church, and I wot not where. I have been well
exercised these twenty years to suffer and bear evil reports
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
and lies; and have not been mych grieved thereat, and have
borne all things quietly. Yet when untrue reports and lies
turn to the hindrance of God’s truth, they be in no wise to be
tolerated and suffered. Wherefore, these be to signify to the
world, that it was not I that did set up the mass at Canterbury;
but it was a false, flattering, lying and dissembling monk
which caused the mass to be set up there, without my advice
or counsel. [Here Foxe has the words omitted by Strype,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘Reddet illi Dominus in die illo’</span>.] And as for offering myself,
to say mass before the Queen’s Highness, or in any other
place, I never did, as her Grace knoweth well. But if her
Grace will give me leave, I shall be ready to prove against all
that will say the contrary, that the Communion Book, set
forth by the most innocent and godly Prince, King Edward
VI. in his high court of Parliament is conformable to the
order which our Saviour Christ did both observe and command
to be observed, and which his Apostles and primitive
church used many years. Whereas the mass in many things
not only hath no foundation of Christ, his Apostles, nor the
primitive church, but also is manifest contrary to the same,
and contains many horrible blasphemies in it. And although
many either unlearned or maliciously do report that Mr. Peter
Martyr<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329"
class="fnanchor">[329]</a> is unlearned, yet if the Queen’s Highness will graunt
thereunto, I with the said Mr. Peter Martyr, and other four
or five which I shall choose, will by God’s grace, take upon us
to defend that not only our Common Prayers of the churches,
ministration of sacraments, and other rites and ceremonies, but
also that all the doctrine and religion by our said sovereign
lord King Edward VI. is more pure and according to God’s
word than any that hath been used in England these thousand
years; so that God’s word may be the judge, and that
the reason and proofs may be set out in writing, to the intent
as well that all the world may examine and judge them, as
that no man shall start back from their writing; and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
faith hath been in the church these fifteen hundred years, we
will join them in this point, that the same doctrine and usage
is to be followed which was in the church fifteen hundred years
past. And we shall prove that the order of the church set out
at this present, in this church of England by Act of Parliament,
is the same that was used in the church fifteen hundred
years past—and so shall they never be able to prove theirs.”<a name="FNanchor_330_330"
id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330"
class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<p>This document was copied in all the scriveners’ shops in
London, circulated widely and posted up in Cheapside. Foxe,
with his wonted inaccuracy, says that the Archbishop was,
in consequence, summoned before the Commissioners of St.
Paul’s, and interrogated by Bishop Heath, and by Scory,
Bishop of Rochester. Now Scory was not at that time
Bishop of Rochester, neither was Heath on the Commission,
but at the Council Board, which he joined on the 4th September.
Moreover, when on other occasions Cranmer was
summoned before the Commissioners, he did not appear
personally but by proxy. For “Commissioners” we must
therefore read “Council”.</p>

<p>“My Lord,” said Bishop Heath gently, “there is a bill
put forth in your name, wherein you seem to be aggrieved
at setting up Mass again. We doubt not but you are sorry
that it is gone abroad.”</p>

<p>“As I do not deny myself to be the very author of that
bill or letter,” replied Cranmer, “so must I confess here unto
you, that I am sorry that the said bill went from me in such
sort as it did. For when I had written it, Master Scory got
the copy of me, and it is now come abroad, and as I understand,
the city is full of it. For which I am sorry that it is
so passed my hands, for I had intended otherwise to have
made it in a more large and ample manner, and minded
to have set it on Paul’s church door, and on the doors
of all the churches in London, with mine own seal joined
thereto.”</p>

<p>He was then ordered to appear the following day in the
Star Chamber, and, after a long and serious debate, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
committed to the Tower, “as well for the treason committed
by him against the Queen’s Highness, as for the aggravating
the same his offence by spreading abroad seditious bills,
moving tumults, to the disquietness of the present State”.<a name="FNanchor_331_331"
id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>The Archbishop had had ample opportunity for flight
had he been so inclined, but he persistently refused to take
advantage of it, though he advised others in like danger to
escape to the continent.<a name="FNanchor_332_332"
id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332"
class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Great numbers did so, and went
to Strassburg, Antwerp, Worms, Frankfort or Geneva, in
all of which cities the new doctrines obtained. Among the
fugitives were the Bishops of Winchester, Wells, Chichester,
Exeter and Ossory; the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford,
and those of Westminster, Exeter, Durham, Wells and Chichester;
and the Archbishop’s brother Edmund, Archdeacon of
Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333"
class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Peter Martyr also applied for passports which
were granted without reluctance, and five days after Cranmer’s
committal, he left England “with great safety and unnecessary
precaution”.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334"
class="fnanchor">[334]</a> The government apparently connived also at
Latimer’s escape, for the Bishop received warning of the coming
of a pursuivant from the Council. The pursuivant did no
more than deliver a letter and depart, after which plenty of
time was left, in the hope that he would take flight. But he
did not budge, and accordingly, on the 13th September, the
Council Register states that “This day Hugh Latimer, clerk,
appeared before the lords, and for his seditious demeanour
was committed to the Tower, there to remain a close prisoner,
having attending upon him one Austin, his servant”.<a name="FNanchor_335_335"
id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>Mary was Queen, but not entirely mistress of her kingdom.
De Noailles was careful to keep the coals stirred continually,
and was responsible for at least half the discontent that
prevailed in London. Elizabeth, whose vanity prompted her
to pose as the centre of attraction everywhere, coquetted with
the French ambassador, with the populace, with the leaders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
of the Protestant party, without committing herself to any
overt act of rebellion. She was already mistress in the arts
of innuendo, dissimulation and intrigue. The treachery of
de Noailles made her the stalking-horse of the Reformers,
although the ambassador expressed to his master a fear, that
her obstinacy in refusing to go to Mass would shortly land
her in the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336"
class="fnanchor">[336]</a> But he was not even sincere in his
treachery, for lightly as he imperilled Elizabeth’s life by
encouraging the Princess to associate herself with the factious,
it was scarcely his aim in the event of a successful insurrection
to place her on the throne. Mary Queen of Scots was Mary
Tudor’s next legitimate heir, and as the wife of the Dauphin
would, if she mounted the throne of England, bring to a
glorious end the humiliation under which the French had
smarted for centuries, in seeing the English monarchs, their
rivals, quartering the arms, and coolly assuming the style of
Kings of France. But of these ulterior views the ambassador’s
friends in England were totally ignorant, and perhaps even
Elizabeth, with all her cleverness, was at least once in her life
completely outwitted. It was constantly represented to the
Queen, that her sister’s attitude was a serious danger to the
government, and the imperial ambassadors urged that the
Princess should be banished from London, where she was
surrounded by partisans, and if she would not conform to the
Catholic faith, it would be better for her to be in prison than
out of it. Mary, loth to coerce, tried to persuade her by the
force of example, and would hear five or six Masses daily,
surrounded by the members of her Privy Council, all of whom
had been, till recently, ardent Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_337_337"
id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Elizabeth and
Anne of Cleves were the only persons at court who still held
out. At last, alarmed at the sinister reports that reached her,
Mary told her sister, that if she wished to remain near her
person, she must break with the new doctrines, and with those
who professed them.</p>

<p>Considering then, that she had done enough to exculpate
herself in the eyes of those who had been carefully taught to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
look on her as their Joshua, Elizabeth threw herself at the
Queen’s feet, and with streaming eyes expressed her sorrow
at having seemingly lost her Majesty’s affection. She could
account for it, she declared, in no other way than her profession
of the reformed religion, for which, however, she ought
to be excused, as having been brought up in it, and never
taught any other. Perhaps, she pleaded, if she were provided
with books, and aided by the instructions of divines, she might
see her errors, and embrace the religion of her fathers. Her
conversion was the work of a week. She went to Mass with
the Queen, on the 8th September, and soon after, opened a
chapel in her own house, and sent to Flanders for a chalice,
cross and vestments.<a name="FNanchor_338_338"
id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338"
class="fnanchor">[338]</a> De Noailles, without laying claim to
great sagacity, might well express his opinion that all this
proceeded more from policy than from any deep religious conviction.
Up to the last moment before going to Mass, Elizabeth
did all she could to persuade her Protestant friends that
she was merely acting under compulsion. Even on her way
to the chapel, she sighed and groaned, and gave out that she
was ill. Renard too, doubted the sincerity of her conversion,
especially as she did not appear at Mass on the Sundays
following, and he besought the Queen to secure her person, as
a frequenter and abettor of rebels. Mary assured him that she
had also had grave misgivings, had already sent for her sister
and implored her to say frankly whether she was a Catholic
and shared the Catholic belief in the Eucharist, or whether,
as it had been affirmed, her conversion were a feint or the
result of fear. Elizabeth, the Queen said, had professed herself
ready to declare in public that she had acted in accordance
with the dictates of her conscience, without feint, fear or dissimulation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
but in saying these words she had trembled from
head to foot.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339"
class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Renard and his colleagues continued to regard
her as the champion of the disaffected, and were careful to
bring to the Queen’s notice the persistent rumours concerning
her. But Mary, on her guard perhaps, lest she should lend a
too willing ear, as persistently refused to act upon them, continued
to call Elizabeth her “good sister,” held her by the hand
at all the great court ceremonies, and showered kindnesses and
gifts upon her. Among other jewels, she gave her a brooch
about this time, representing the story of Pyramus and Thisbe,
with a magnificent table diamond, and four rubies; two volumes
bound in massive gold, the one set with rubies, with a
diamond clasp, the other containing the portraits of Mary’s
father and mother; a white coral rosary mounted in gold,
etc.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340"
class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Either from fear of displeasing the Puritans by ornamenting
herself with gems, or for some other reason, Elizabeth
avoided either wearing or using her sister’s presents.<a name="FNanchor_341_341"
id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<p>One of the distinguishing features of the new reign was the
style of dress adopted by the court. By restoring something
of the splendour that had distinguished it in the early days of
Henry VIII., by bringing dancing and music again into vogue,
and by abolishing the sombre Puritanical fashion of Edward’s
reign, Mary had given a much-needed impetus to trade, and
while she offended some by her sumptuous attire, the change
found favour with the many, weary of the dull, colourless garments,
which for six years had been supposed to indicate a state
of salvation. De Noailles told his master that the Queen had
abolished the former “<i>superstition</i>” regarding ladies’ dress,
which had forbidden them hitherto to wear gold ornaments or
coloured clothes, and that her Majesty herself, and the ladies
of the court were adorned with jewels and dressed
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la française</span></i>,
with wide sleeves to their gowns.<a name="FNanchor_342_342"
id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p>In consequence of the revival of industries, money at once
began to circulate more freely, and this naturally exercised
a beneficial effect on the nation at large, long the prey of
poverty and discontent. Those only had been satisfied who
were enriched by the plunder of churches and monasteries.
The monopoly of land having been one of Henry’s chief
objects in seizing Church property, every stray piece of waste
ground was enclosed and rack-rented, so that the poor man,
who had hitherto been able to keep a cow and a few sheep,
could not afterwards so much as find food for a goose or a hen.
The fishing population, since days of abstinence from meat
were no longer obligatory, suffered as much as the country
people, for the fisheries declined, through want of a market to
dispose of the smack-loads with which the ports were glutted.
The suppression of the religious houses affected the arts and
crafts throughout the country. Nine years afterwards, at the
beginning of Edward’s reign, it was found necessary to deal
with vagrancy by legislation. The indigent had become the
great bulk of the nation, while those who had grown rich
with the wealth which had formerly been distributed at the
convent gates, thought of nothing less than of feeding the
hungry. Stringent poor-laws were enacted, but failed to meet
the difficulty. A vagrant might be pressed into the service
of any person who met him on the King’s highway. If he
refused to do the work assigned to him, how vile soever it
might be, he was branded with the letter V, and adjudged a
slave for two years, to be fed on bread and water and refuse
meat. A first attempt at escape was punished by the slave
being branded with an S, after which he was kept a slave for
life. A second attempt resulted in a felon’s death. From
all this Mary delivered her people. Poverty under her was
no longer considered a crime, and if there is one special reason
more than another for honouring her memory it is her love
and care for the poor and afflicted, of which we shall presently
see many examples.<a name="FNanchor_343_343"
id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343"
class="fnanchor">[343]</a> But besides the able-bodied vagrants,
a vast number of feeble, halt, blind and wretched vagabonds

lay and crept begging in the miry streets of London and
Westminster. Money, urgently needed to reanimate commerce,
and pay the debts of the Crown, had been squandered
in the erection of expensive public buildings. In Sorranzo’s
report on England in 1553, the Venetian ambassador says
of London, that on the banks of the river were many fine
palaces, making a grand show, but that the rest of the city
was much disfigured by the ruins of a multitude of churches
and monasteries, belonging heretofore to friars and nuns.
The population was dense, numbering 180,000 souls.<a name="FNanchor_344_344"
id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Mary
found, not merely an impoverished exchequer, but a mass of
royal debts. In 1551 Edward’s liabilities had amounted to
£241,179 14s. 10d.; in 1553 they still exceeded £190,000.<a name="FNanchor_345_345"
id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
Immediately on her accession, the Queen acknowledged herself
answerable for the salaries, three years in arrear, of all
the Crown officials, although she had no longer a private
purse; and while one royal proclamation restored a depreciated
currency, setting forth the Queen’s “tender care to her
loving subjects,” adding how sensible she was of “the great
intolerable charges had come to her subjects by base money,”<a name="FNanchor_346_346"
id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
another remitted two odious and oppressive taxes levied by
the late Parliament. These were subsidies of four shillings
in the pound on land, and two shillings and eightpence on
goods, a burden that had weighed heavily on the small
merchants and farmers.</p>

<p>Mary’s scrupulous justice and honesty left little wherewith
to make a show of generosity. It had ever been the custom
for English monarchs to reward those who had fought in their
quarrel, with rich gifts of land and money, but clamour as her
friends might, the Queen would not make grants of Church
property, and there were few other resources at her command.
“She is so poor,” said de Noailles, “that her want of money
is apparent, even to the dishes put upon her table.”</p>

<p>Her choice of Gardiner as Chancellor was fortunate for the
rehabilitation of the public finances. His ability in this direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
was undeniable, his integrity known to all, and while he
lived, however low the state of her coffers, Mary was never in
debt. An Englishman to a fault, rough, uncouth and frank,
often to incivility, Gardiner was liked by few. Both the French
and Imperial ambassadors hated him cordially. Renard added
distrust to his relations with him, remembering the active
part which he had taken in the divorce of Queen Katharine,
and in the declaration of the royal supremacy. He could not
believe in the sincerity of the man, who was in reality burning
with desire to prove it. But apart from his past history,
Gardiner’s actual attitude was an obstacle to imperial interests
in England. His patriotism, no less than his honesty and
common sense, led him to discern that no matrimonial alliance,
however brilliant, would be acceptable to the nation, if contracted
with a foreigner. Fear and abhorrence of any “foreign
potentate” having jurisdiction in this realm had become part
and parcel of that insular prejudice, which had sprung up since
the separation from Rome, a prejudice which Mary underrated,
if she did not entirely ignore it, while Renard, to make the
situation acute, was entrusted with a secret mission from the
Emperor to bring about a marriage between her and his
son, the Prince of Spain. There were henceforth three antagonistic
parties in the State—the Spanish, the loyal English
headed by Gardiner, and the disloyal, leagued secretly with
the French.</p>

<p>To de Noailles, polished, urbane and ceremonious, an
ultra Frenchman, the Chancellor was peculiarly obnoxious.
Gardiner had always had a reputation for want of courtesy,
and on his release, the French ambassador was the first to
observe that imprisonment had not civilised him.<a name="FNanchor_347_347"
id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> But if
these two, who were working to some extent for the same
ends,<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348"
class="fnanchor">[348]</a> had joined forces, they might together have defeated
the Emperor’s schemes. They were however natural enemies,
the invincible element of deceit and treachery in de Noailles
revolting Gardiner, even more than his own want of tact disgusted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the Frenchman. Pugnacious, outspoken, and strong in
the integrity of his intention, the Chancellor held his own in
the Council, although he was opposed throughout by Arundel
and Paget, who favoured the imperial policy. But highly
as she esteemed him for his probity, he was powerless to influence
the Queen. The subject of her marriage exercised
the minds of all parties in the State. Even her ladies talked
to her of nothing else, and Mary herself, who had hitherto
preferred to remain unmarried, acquiesced in the general
understanding, that it was for the common weal she should
now choose a husband. Before her public entry into London,
Renard had secretly waited upon her at New Hall, to treat of
the matter. She had told him, that before succeeding to the
throne, she had resolved to end her days as a celibate, but that
now another duty had been imposed on her. She was resolved,
she said, to follow the Emperor’s advice, and to choose the
consort whom he approved, for after God, she desired to obey
him as a father. Only she besought him to consider her age,
and not to press her to treat of matrimony with any whom she
had not seen and heard. She gave Renard to understand that
she had not been deceived by the Emperor’s feigned advice to
her ambassadors at Brussels, that she should marry one of her
own nobles, and that she even suspected them of having interpolated
the sentence in which it was contained, to suit their
own inclinations. On receiving Renard’s letter, containing an
account of this audience, Charles replied that the Queen plainly
showed by what she had said, that she inclined towards marriage
with a foreigner.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349"
class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<p>A few days later (according to de Noailles, on the 12th
August) Mary repeated formally what she had already said
to Renard, that for State reasons she had resolved to marry,
and that seeing no suitable match in her own kingdom, she
would form an alliance with a foreigner, trusting that the
Emperor would propose a Catholic, and arrange for her to see
and speak with the aspirant to her hand. She stipulated
earnestly that he should not be too young.<a name="FNanchor_350_350"
id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the prisoners already mentioned as having been
liberated on her accession was Edward Courtenay, son of the
Marquis of Exeter. Descended like his cousin, Reginald
Pole, from the royal family, through his mother, Courtenay
possessed advantages of birth sufficient to justify his being
put forward as a candidate for the Queen’s favour; but in
spite of all that has been written on the subject, it is more
than doubtful, whether Mary, even for a moment, thought
seriously of marrying him. With the whole Renard correspondence
before us, it seems certain that from the beginning
she had placed her destiny in the hands of the Emperor, and
was resolved to abide by his choice.</p>

<p>Courtenay was handsome and fascinating in appearance,
of noble carriage and distinguished manners; at the time
of his release from the Tower, he was twenty-six years old,
fourteen of which had been spent in prison. The Queen, as
if she could not do enough to compensate him for the long
injustice he had suffered, lavished honours and benefits upon
him. She restored to him the earldom of Devon, and
his confiscated estates of the marquisate of Exeter; and de
Noailles surmised that, had he continued to deserve favours,
the dukedom of York was in store for him.<a name="FNanchor_351_351"
id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> His mother
was made first lady of the court, and slept with the Queen.
Courtenay became for a time the idol of the people, who
would gladly have seen him married to their sovereign; but
the idea probably originated with Gardiner, who had conceived
an affection for the young man during their common
imprisonment. He did his utmost to induce Mary to marry
him, and had Courtenay proved himself worthy, and had the
Chancellor and de Noailles worked in concert, she might
possibly have raised him to the throne, their united action
overcoming the Emperor’s influence, but there was no foundation
for de Noailles’ absurd theory that she was in love with
him. Scarcely was he out of the Tower, than intoxicated
with his first sweet draught of freedom, he abandoned himself
to every kind of dissipation, and frequented the loosest company.
London echoed with tales of his excesses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<p>Even in those early days, his name was as often coupled
with Elizabeth’s as with the Queen’s, and at the beginning of
August, the imperial ambassadors told Mary that Courtenay
and her sister were in collusion. They were careful also to
keep her informed of his new way of life, which caused her
great indignation, though de Noailles persisted in declaring
that she was so deeply enamoured of him, that she would
put up with all his licentiousness, and marry him in spite of
everything. Unfounded as these assertions were, they gained
considerable credence at home and abroad, and Prosper de
Sainte Croix wrote to Cardinal del Monte, that it was very
likely that the Queen of England would decide on Courtenay
as a husband, as she had lately given him a diamond worth
16,000 crowns, which King Henry used to wear. But while
Mary declared in public, that it was not to her honour to
marry a subject, she told her friends privately that his immorality
would alone prove a sufficient barrier. The French
ambassador was not so blinded by his illusion, as not to
perceive that Courtenay was fast ruining whatever prospects
he might have had, and with facile diplomacy he caught
the ball at the rebound, and still carried on the game in the
interests of France. If Mary’s disappointed suitor were not
to be a convenient foil to Spain, by marrying the Queen, he
might still be valuable as a name to conjure with in connection
with Elizabeth. If only he were a little more enterprising
and a trifle less timid, Courtenay and Elizabeth might well
lay themselves out for popularity among the discontented
Protestants. De Noailles entertained him at a banquet,
under cover of his belonging to the Queen’s Privy Council,
flattered and encouraged him, and let fall a few tentative
words, to the effect that he should push his fortunes. A few
days later, Courtenay was seen leaving the French ambassador’s
house disguised, at midnight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gardiner, and with him most of the loyalists,
disappointed in the new Earl of Devon, looked to Reginald
Pole as their next best hope. Mary was known to have an
affectionate regard for her kinsman, and she owed him, moreover,
a debt of gratitude. It will be remembered that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
had been once before a question of their marriage. But Pole,
although not yet irrevocably pledged to the ecclesiastical
state, being only in minor orders, was without ambition, and
had no desire for matrimony. He even thought that the
Queen, being of the age she was, should remain single, and
leave the succession to take its course; and he charged his
friend, Pedro Soto, to say this to the Emperor. But the
Council were greatly concerned to negotiate a suitable match,
and the only two eligible Englishmen being henceforth out of
the reckoning, they turned their attention successively to the
King of Denmark, the Infant of Portugal, the Prince of Piedmont
and to Ferdinand of Austria, King of the Romans. But
during this time, Renard was not idle. Having sounded Mary
with regard to the Prince of Spain, he proceeded diligently to
combat her objections. In his first interview at New Hall,
he had merely put forward the suggestion of a marriage; by
degrees Philip’s name was introduced, and when he judged
that the time was come for delivering the Emperor’s message,
he flattered himself that the day was won, because she smiled
as she listened. Writing to the Bishop of Arras, Cardinal
Granvelle, he said, “Je connais ladite reine, tant facile, tant
bonne, tant peu expérimentée des choses du monde et d’état,
tant novice en toutes choses.... Et pour vous dire confidemment
ce que me semble d’elle, je suis en opinion que si Dieu
ne la garde, elle se trouvera trompée et abusée, soit par pratiques
des Français, soit par conspirations particulières de
ceux du pays, soit par poison ou autrement.”<a name="FNanchor_352_352"
id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>Mary has been represented by some modern historians as
eagerly desiring the marriage with Philip, as greedily swallowing
the tempting bait, her passion overleaping every obstacle.
Nothing is farther from the truth, and those who have carefully
followed her career step by step hitherto, will readily
acknowledge, that such a reading of her character is altogether
at variance with the whole tenour of her life. With regard
to this marriage, she saw difficulties on all sides, and observed
to Renard that the suitors proposed to her were so young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
that she might be the mother of them all, and reminded him
that his Highness, the Prince of Spain, was twelve years
younger than herself. She also objected that he would naturally
wish to pass much of his time in Spain, ordering and
administering the affairs of his kingdom, and that this would
constitute an immense drawback to the marriage, adding that
she had never seriously contemplated matrimony until God
had promoted her to the Crown, nor felt affection for any
man.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353"
class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

<p>After this interview, Renard thought that Mary was more
inclined to the Emperor’s brother, Ferdinand of Austria, who
had attained the mature age of fifty, than to Philip, who was
no older than Courtenay, but he thought, too, that Ferdinand’s
son, Maximilian, had also a fair chance. Nevertheless, he
ceased not to sing Philip’s praises, and before long, all London
was in possession of the secret, that the Emperor was soliciting
the Queen’s hand for his son. None scrupled to express a
disapproval, which became general hostility, when de Noailles
had dexterously insinuated, that the coming of Philip as
their King would mean ruin to the English, followed by the
establishment of the Inquisition. To his master he observed
reasonably enough, that the Spanish marriage of the Queen
would be “to the great displeasure of all, with perpetual war
against your Majesty, the Scotch and her own subjects, who
will unwillingly suffer the rule of a foreigner”.<a name="FNanchor_354_354"
id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>The simmering discontent was momentarily allayed by the
prospect of the Queen’s coronation on the 1st October, and
by the issuing far and wide of writs for the assembling of
Parliament on the 4th.</p>

<p>The Londoners had ever loved a spectacle, and having
been deprived for six years of every outward and visible sign
of rejoicing, their whole energies were now turned to the devising
of a succession of brilliant pageants, wherein they proposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
to do honour to the Queen. They flattered themselves
that at the meeting of Parliament, all difficulties would be
adjusted.</p>

<p>The Queen, entirely occupied with the solemnity before
her, had applied through Renard to the Bishop of Arras,
Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle, to procure the chrism to be
used in her anointing. The Bishop, in sending the three
different unctions necessary, excused himself for not enclosing
them in a more costly box, saying that, as no artist
(<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nul maistre</span></i>)
had been willing to undertake the preparation of a more ornate
receptacle in less than three weeks, he sent the box which
he usually carried about with him, choosing to execute her
Majesty’s commission in a rough and ready manner, rather
than to fail altogether by being too late.<a name="FNanchor_355_355"
id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> On the same day
the Papal Nuncio told Cardinal del Monte, that Mary had
resolved no longer to style herself supreme Head of the Church
of England, but simply Queen of France and England, that
she had caused coin to be struck with her effigy on one side,
and on the other, the legend <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Veritas temporis filia</span></i>,
that she
had abrogated several taxes, and had ordered that Mass
should again be offered throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>At two o’clock on the afternoon of the 30th September
the Queen left the Tower, and passed through the city to her
coronation in Westminster Abbey. Elizabeth and Anne of
Cleves followed Mary’s chariot, which was covered with cloth
of gold, in one only a little less splendid, covered with cloth
of silver. After them came the ladies of the court. “All
the streets from the Tower to Temple Bar were richly hung
with divers costly pageants.”<a name="FNanchor_356_356"
id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>That night, the court remained at Westminster Palace, and
the next day, all walked in solemn procession on foot to the
Abbey, where Mary was crowned by Stephen Gardiner,
Bishop of Winchester; the Archbishop of Canterbury, on
whom the office would naturally have fallen, being in prison.
To a superficial observer all would have appeared as satisfactory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
as possible; the cheers of the people were hearty and
spontaneous, and the Queen, deeply impressed by the significance
of the act she was accomplishing, was yet not so entirely
wrapt in her devotions, but that she had a kindly look
and smile for the crowd that pressed round her on all sides.
Behind her stood Elizabeth, and Anne of Cleves, both Princesses
wearing dresses of crimson velvet trimmed with ermine;
on their heads were crowns of gold, ablaze with precious stones
of great size and value. The Queen’s crown, sceptre, sword
and other insignia of the regal office were carried by the
highest dignitaries in the State. Renard watched Elizabeth
closely, and noticed signs of intelligence between her and the
French ambassador. After the ceremony, as the royal procession
was moving towards Westminster Hall, he heard her
complain to de Noailles of the weight of the crown she was
wearing. “Have patience,” he replied, “it is only the preliminary
to one that will sit more lightly.”<a name="FNanchor_357_357"
id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>On Thursday, the 5th October, the first Parliament of
Mary’s reign met “to consider chiefly the restoration of religion”.</p>

<p>Great interest had been taken throughout the realm, in the
election of the 430 members who made up on the opening
day an unusually full House. Even Froude, who will not be
suspected of partiality, admits<a name="FNanchor_358_358"
id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358"
class="fnanchor">[358]</a> that “on the whole it was perhaps
the fairest election which had taken place for many years”.</p>

<p>Mary opened Parliament in person, “the Queen riding
from Whitehall in her Parliament robes, with all the lords
spiritual and temporal in their Parliament robes; and had
a solemn Mass of the Holy Ghost sung in Westminster
Church, with a sermon made by Dr. Heath, Bishop of Chichester”.<a name="FNanchor_359_359"
id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>Afterwards, the Lord Chancellor, addressing both Houses,
extolled the virtue, piety and clemency of their sovereign. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
speech was received with enthusiasm, and hopes were entertained
that the Queen’s measures would be passed without
opposition. Five days later, Mary sent down a bill for the
abrogation of all laws concerning religion that had been passed
during the two preceding reigns, one clause of the bill dealing
especially with her mother’s divorce, and the question of her
own legitimacy. The peers passed it without debate, but in
the Lower House some stormy scenes attended the reading.
The Commons had imagined that Mary would be content
to restore religion to the condition in which her father had
left it, and now they perceived, in the proposed abrogation
of the decree of divorce, not merely a recognition of the
Pope’s dispensing power, but an attempt to re-establish his
jurisdiction in England. For this, the majority of the nation
were unprepared. For twenty years and more, the Pope’s
authority had been treated with contempt, his jurisdiction
denied, his claims ridiculed, his name converted into a mark
of infamy, and only mentioned with the foulest abuse. The
language of the Reformers admirably promoted the effect
which Henry VIII. wished to produce on the national mind,
and by constant repetition of every scurrilous term of opprobrium,
they had gained the popular ear. Few, at the
beginning of Mary’s reign, were of so judicial a mind as to
distinguish the real Pope from the bugbear that had been set
up. Moreover, at the back of the prejudice lurked the fear,
as yet vague and undefined, of a possible contingency, involving
the restoration of Church property, on which so many had
become rich. But besides the old and the middle-aged, with
whom these things weighed, a fresh generation had sprung
up, to whom the Papacy, if not the execrable institution that
it was popularly believed to be, yet savoured too much of
the past, and of those dreary mediæval times, from which the
world was escaping as from a tomb. Too recent to appear
picturesque, the Middle Ages were, to the pioneers of the
new era, out of date and old-fashioned, terms far more
injurious than the most violent word-war of the preachers.
Filled with the new wine of the Renaissance, these youthful
enthusiasts formed the nucleus of that phalanx of life-loving,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
exuberant personalities who, throwing all their energies into
the glorification of liberty, fame, pleasure, and earthly beauty,
gave us subsequently the Elizabethan age. To all of these
the very shadow of a spiritual authority was repellant, and
the whole session would doubtless have worn itself out in
wrangling, had not the Queen, coming unexpectedly to the
House, seen how matters stood. She promptly affixed the
royal assent to three bills that had been passed, and prorogued
Parliament for three days. During this interval, two
separate bills were framed in the place of the one obnoxious
one, the first dealing exclusively with the confirmation of
Henry’s first marriage. To make this bill acceptable to the
Commons, all allusion to the Pope was avoided. The royal
couple, it stated, had lived together in lawful matrimony
for twenty years, after which time, unfounded scruples and
projects of divorce had been suggested to the King, by
interested persons, who, to further their schemes, obtained by
threats and bribery the seals of national and foreign universities
in favour of the divorce, the sentence being ungodlily
pronounced by Thomas, the newly made Archbishop of
Canterbury, against all principles of equity and conscience,
and in the absence of Queen Katharine. The sentence had
afterwards been ratified by Parliament, but as the marriage
was not prohibited by divine law, it could not be dissolved
by any such authority. The bill required therefore that the
marriage should be adjudged good and valid.<a name="FNanchor_360_360"
id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>Although what was demanded was tantamount to a decree
bastardising Elizabeth, not a dissentient voice was raised
against the bill in either House.<a name="FNanchor_361_361"
id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>

<p>The second bill was framed in such a manner as to allay
the fears of the holders of Church property, and to reassure
those who dreaded a return to Papal jurisdiction. It made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
therefore no mention of ecclesiastical property, neither did it
touch the vital question of the royal supremacy, but simply
aimed at the re-establishment of religion as it was left at
Henry’s death, with the repeal of nine Acts passed by the
influence of Edward’s Council. The debate lasted two days
in the Lower House, two-thirds of which consisted of friends
of the new doctrines. Nevertheless, the bill passed without
a division, and Cranmer’s ingenious compromise between
Catholicism, Lutheranism and Calvinism was abolished.<a name="FNanchor_362_362"
id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>The other bills passed in this session related to the Acts,
bonds, deeds and writings passed during the nine days’ usurpation,
and were made as binding in law, as if Mary’s name had
stood for Jane’s. It was also decreed, that nothing should be
accounted treason but what fell under the famous statute of
Edward III., nor felony but what was so understood in the
first year of Henry VIII. The Acts against riotous gatherings
passed in the reign of Edward VI. were revived; several persons
attainted were restored in blood, and their estates given back
to them. Those who had been foremost in actively conspiring
to exclude Mary from the throne were attainted. These
were, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Guildford and Lord
Ambrose Dudley, and the Lady Jane.</p>

<p>All these measures were passed without serious obstacle;
the real crux lay in the question of the Queen’s marriage.
On the 6th September, de Noailles had been informed by one
of the Howards, especially trusted by Mary, of her secret
interview with Renard, and of his formal proposal to her from
the Emperor, to marry Philip of Spain. The French ambassador
lost no time in informing his master of the threatened
danger to France, requesting that his brother, the protonotary,
François de Noailles, might be accredited as his coadjutor in
the difficult diplomatic situation likely to ensue. The following
night, he sent for one of Courtenay’s friends, and advised
him and his party to acquire as many allies as possible among
those who came personally into contact with the Queen and
the members of Parliament, soon to be assembled. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
latter were to be incensed against Spain, and brought to
petition her Majesty not to take a foreigner for her consort.
On the 8th, he had an interview with Sorranzo, the Venetian
envoy, whom he found ready to enter into his schemes, although
Sorranzo had received no instructions from his government, on
the subject of the Queen’s marriage. But so great was his
dread of any further aggrandisement of the House of Austria,
that he was willing to listen to anything de Noailles had to
propose. On the 9th, the French ambassador sought out
Gardiner, and harangued him for two hours, on the dangers
and disadvantages of the proposed union—to the Queen who
would soon find herself forsaken by her husband—to the
ministers who knew well that Spaniards were not people to
suffer opposition in the government—to the realm at large
which would see its fortresses occupied by foreigners, and be
itself drawn into a war with France, “for,” said he, “if the
Emperor married his son to the Queen of England,” it was
“with the intention that she, in accepting him, should take
upon herself all his quarrels”.<a name="FNanchor_363_363"
id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>To these arguments Gardiner more than agreed, but he
was careful not to show his hand completely. He had been
the first to remonstrate with Mary, urging the dislike of the
English to foreigners, the arrogance of Spain in particular,
and the danger of a perpetual war with the French, who
would never agree to the Low Countries being annexed to
England. But opposed to the Chancellor were the Duke of
Norfolk, the Earl of Arundel, Paget and Rochester, so that
Gardiner could no longer be said to control the Council. De
Noailles declared that they were in the pay of the Emperor.
His manipulation of the popular feeling was the cleverest
stroke of all. He caused it to be widely circulated, that
immediately on his arrival and marriage, Philip would seize
the Tower and the royal treasure, and make so many innovations
that the laws would be entirely subverted, the rights of
Parliament suppressed, the Inquisition established and the
people trodden under the heel of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_364_364"
id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> In his anxiety to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
prevent the union, he overstepped his master’s commands,
unless the letter which Henry II. wrote to him, prescribing
moderation, was a mere blind, intended to be shown to the
Queen. Henry’s private instructions to his ambassador regarding
his personal dealings with Mary were, that he should
go to work very delicately, not seeming to wish to prevent
the marriage, which would only cause her to be still more
determined in its favour, but that gently he should continue
to express doubt of the possibility of such an alliance, so
odious to the King of France, since her Majesty had expressed
a wish to live in peace with him.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the second session, the Commons,
largely under the influence of de Noailles, waited a fortnight
for the opportunity to present the Queen with an address
which they had voted on the all-engrossing subject. Pleading
illness, Mary sought time for further reflection. Then she
sent suddenly for the Lower House, to attend on her at once.
The Speaker presented himself, accompanied by twenty members,
all that could be collected in haste. In his hurry, he
had forgotten to provide himself with the address, but his
eloquence made up for all deficiencies of form. He spoke
so long and tediously, that Mary became impatient, and sat
down, contrary to her wont. With a great deal of circumlocution,
he prayed the Queen to marry, but not to choose a
husband among foreigners, and he expatiated on the advantages
she would derive from a union with a member of the
English nobility. Such language, respectful though it might
be, was not such as to be acceptable to Tudor ears, and in an
aside, Mary exclaimed that she would be a match for all her
Chancellor’s cunning.<a name="FNanchor_365_365"
id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365"
class="fnanchor">[365]</a> When the Speaker had finished, she
rose to reply, although the answer should rightly have devolved
on Gardiner, as Chancellor, an innovation that caused
Paget to rally him afterwards on his disgrace, the Queen
having deprived him of his office. Her words were short and
characteristic: “For that you desire to see us married,” she
said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
“we thank you. Your desire to dictate to us the consort
whom we shall choose, we consider somewhat superfluous.
The English Parliament has not been wont to use such
language to its sovereigns, and when private persons on such
matters suit their own tastes, sovereigns may reasonably be
allowed to choose whom they prefer.” Herewith she dismissed
them, and a few days later, Parliament was dissolved.<a name="FNanchor_366_366"
id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>The truth was, that in the interval of her seclusion, Mary
had been making up her mind. In an interview with Renard
on the 14th October, she had questioned him minutely as
to Philip’s character and disposition, entreating him several
times to tell her truly, whether the Prince was in fact moderate,
well-regulated, and such in very deed as he had been
described to her. She seized both of Renard’s hands, and
implored him to be open with her, speaking to her as if he
were her confessor. Renard protested warmly that he was
ready to pledge his honour and his life, that the Prince of
Spain was all that she could desire in a husband. Still,
only half-satisfied, Mary continued to express regret that a
meeting should be considered impracticable, before her final
decision.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367"
class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>In default of the original, whom the Emperor would by
no means subject to the insulting possibility of not pleasing, a
portrait of the Prince by Titian, was sent for Mary’s acceptance
by the Queen of Hungary, Philip’s aunt.<a name="FNanchor_368_368"
id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>Charles was not greatly disturbed by the manner in which
his overtures had been received in England. The English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
opinion of Spaniards was not less flattering than his and
Renard’s of the English. “Your Majesty knows,” wrote the
imperial ambassador, “that the temper and self-will of the
English are extremely turbulent. They love change and
novelty, either because of their insular position, or by reason
of their habitual contact with the sea, or because their morals
are corrupt. Your Majesty is aware how in times past their
kings have been obliged to treat them with rigour, even
shedding royal blood, in order to maintain their control over
them, for which reason they have acquired the reputation of
being cruel tyrants.” He went on to draw a picture of all
that a foreign prince must be, if he would hope to gain the
good-will of the English people. The affection of the nobility
might, he explained, be won by rich banquets and entertainments,
by dazzling them with great wealth, by giving them
the means of enriching themselves, and by showing them an
example of valour, in arms and knighthood.</p>

<p>Renard was not far wrong in accusing the people of
turbulence. Excited to fever heat by de Noailles’ treachery,
they confounded the Queen’s marriage with purely religious
questions, and in defiance of all reason, attacked the Catholic
religion merely because it was that of Spain. Preachers were
insulted in their pulpits; it became unsafe to say Mass in
public. The rebellious tone of the Londoners communicated
itself to the provinces, especially to the home counties, and to
Devonshire, the cradle of the Courtenay family. A circular
letter from the Queen to her Council declared, that “certain
ill-disposed persons meaning, under the pretence of misliking
this marriage to rebel against the Catholic religion, and divine
service restored within this our realm, and to take from us
their sovereign Lady and Queen that liberty which is not
denied to the meanest women in the choice of their husbands,
cease not to spread many false, vile and untrue reports of our
said cousin and others of that nation”.<a name="FNanchor_369_369"
id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<p>The opposition of the Commons, gently as it had been
expressed, seems to have brought Mary’s uncertainties to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
an end. That same night, she took the fatal step which was
eventually to deprive her of her people’s affection, an affection
that had grown with her from her childhood, had been her
consolation in days of darkness, and had enabled her to
triumph so splendidly over her enemies. A despatch of
Renard’s, addressed to the Emperor, and dated the 31st
October, describes the dramatic scene in which she pledged
herself to marry Philip.</p>

<p>“On Sunday evening, the said Lady sent for me to a
room in which the Blessed Sacrament was exposed, and
declared that since I had presented to her your Majesty’s
letters, she had not been able to sleep, but had wept and
prayed that God would counsel her, and inspire her answer
to the question of marriage, which I had asked at Beaulieu
[New Hall]. She went on to say that as the Blessed Sacrament
was in the room, and she had always invoked it as her
protector, guide and counsellor, she would on this occasion
also willingly ask it to help her. And kneeling down on
both knees, she recited the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Veni Creator Spiritus</span></i>,
there being
in the room only myself and mistress Clarence, who did the
same. But as for mistress Clarence, I do not know whether
she heard the said prayer, but I think so because of the sign
she made me. After the said lady had risen from her knees,
she said, that as your Majesty had chosen me to treat of this
negotiation with her, she had chosen me as her first father
confessor, and your Majesty for the second, and that having
weighed everything, and considered all I had told her, besides
having spoken on the subject to Arundel, Paget and Petre,
and trusting to what I had said of the good qualities and
condition of his Highness, she begged that your Majesty
would be mindful of her, and agree to all the conditions
necessary for the welfare of the kingdom, and continue to be
a good father to her; all the more now that he would be a
double father, and would obtain from his Highness to be a
good husband to her. Feeling admonished by God, who had
already operated so many miracles in her favour, she gave me
her royal word, before the Blessed Sacrament, to marry his
Highness, declaring that she would never change, but love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
him perfectly, and never give him cause for jealousy. She
went on to say that she had feigned illness for two days, but
that her indisposition was merely the result of the difficulty
she had felt in making this resolution. Sire, the joy which I
experienced on hearing this declaration was as great as your
Majesty can imagine, for if she invoked the Holy Spirit, I
indeed invoked the Blessed Trinity, to inspire her to give this
desired answer.”<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370"
class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>This interview was kept so secret, that on the 17th
November, more than a fortnight afterwards, de Noailles knew
nothing of it, and still expressed doubt that Mary would
persist in a matter that was certain to end for her in the
loss of her people’s love; and he could not believe that the
Emperor would risk sending his son into a country, the inhabitants
of which threatened to kill him, rather than recognise
him as their King.<a name="FNanchor_371_371"
id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Nevertheless, it was generally understood
that the Queen had made up her mind, and as a forlorn hope
the people clamoured for the arrival of Cardinal Pole, whom
they credited with being opposed to the match, counting on
his influence with Mary to prevent it. He had been appointed
by Pope Julius III. legate <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a latere</span></i>
and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro pace</span></i>, and had
started for England at the beginning of October. Wotton,
Mary’s ambassador in France, wrote to Sir William Petre as
follows:—</p>

<p>“The Pope has made Cardinal Pole legate <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a latere</span></i>
to the
Emperor and French King, and thereafter he is to go to her
Majesty. His errand is to attempt a reconciliation between
the two former sovereigns, and if any Cardinal is able to do
good in the matter, Pole is that person, being esteemed of an
honest mind and virtuous life, and so much respected by the
Emperor, that at the last vacation of the Papacy, the Imperial
Cardinals laboured to have him made Pope.”<a name="FNanchor_372_372"
id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>Pole, we have seen, was of the opinion that, having remained
thus far unmarried, Mary should not change her state,
but that the succession should be left to take care of itself.
But ignorant of his young cousin’s unworthiness, he had
desired that, if any marriage took place, it might be with
Edward Courtenay, though he abstained from giving any
advice on the subject. He had reached Dillingen, near
Brussels, on his way to England, when the Emperor forbade
his further progress, informing Renard, on the 21st November
that by reason of jealousies, and because the Cardinal might
effectually oppose the Queen’s marriage with his son, Pole
was better where he was.<a name="FNanchor_373_373"
id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373"
class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Renard replied, begging the Emperor
still to detain him, for being Courtenay’s relative, he
might put spokes in the wheel of Spain. There is no doubt
that had he come to England at that time, he would, seeing
the irritation of the people, have done all he could to prevent
the marriage; but the Emperor and Renard were probably
wrong in suspecting him of the least desire to push Courtenay’s
fortunes. A letter from him to his nephew, having been intercepted,
was found to contain nothing but the advice to remain
faithful to the Queen, and to cultivate gratitude for the benefits
which he had received from her.</p>

<p>On the 13th November, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Guildford, Ambrose and Henry Dudley, with the Lady Jane,
proceeded from the Tower on foot, to be arraigned at the
Guildhall for high treason.<a name="FNanchor_374_374"
id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374"
class="fnanchor">[374]</a> All pleaded guilty, Cranmer
protesting that he had acted unwillingly, in deference to the
authority of the officers of the Crown. Parliament confirmed
their attainder, and they were condemned to death. The
Archbishop appealed to the Queen, and hoped that the mercy
that had been extended to so many would be shown to him.<a name="FNanchor_375_375"
id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
Notwithstanding that the prisoners had been convicted, there
was no intention on the part of the Queen to proceed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the extremity of the law. She hoped, by keeping them as
hostages, to secure the loyalty of their friends, an optimistic
view that was not realised. Meanwhile, every indulgence
compatible with their situation was allowed to them. Both
Cranmer and Ridley had the freedom of the Tower, and the
Queen’s garden, in common with the Lady Jane and the
others. Ridley was even sometimes invited to dine at the
Lieutenant’s table. The confinement of Latimer was more
rigorous. He had from the first been ordered into close
prison, with his servant to attend him.</p>

<p>Thus were matters constituted at the end of 1553. Elizabeth
had remained at court for some months, in a not very
enviable position, regarded by the Imperialists as the arch-enemy,
and in reality the object of every plot that was floated.
Her fate seemed to keep her perpetually hovering between
the scaffold and the throne, to which de Noailles bade her
aspire, without intending, even if he succeeded in dethroning
Mary, to help her to mount it. She besought the Queen to
allow her to retire to her house at Ashridge, but Mary hesitated,
in giving her leave to depart, and if she had her watched,
it was with good reason. Her relations with de Noailles had
been discovered, and Arundel and Paget had told the Queen
that the French ambassador had visited the Princess three or
four times under cover of the night, in order to treat secretly
of her marriage.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376"
class="fnanchor">[376]</a> But Elizabeth denied everything, and probably
the accusation regarding the ambassador’s visits was untrue.
At any rate, Mary did not believe it, and took occasion
to make a new act of confidence in her sister. She embraced
her, and gave her two strings of large and magnificent pearls
and some rich sables. On taking leave, Elizabeth entreated
Mary not to believe the reports circulated to her disadvantage
without hearing her. Nevertheless, de Noailles thought that
it only depended on Courtenay, for her to follow him into
Devon and Cornwall, where they would have a good chance
of securing the Crown for themselves. He had some reason
for this belief, the mayor and aldermen of Plymouth, thanks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
to his interference, having sent to beg him to supplicate his
master to take them under his protection. They wished, they
said, to place their town in his hands, and were willing to
receive whatever garrison he would place there, being resolved
not to receive the Prince of Spain, nor to obey his commands
in any way, assuring de Noailles that the country gentlemen
of the neighbourhood would do the same.<a name="FNanchor_377_377"
id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>Gardiner, ignorant of the Queen’s definite step, continued
to struggle against the marriage, till the Emperor, at Lord
Paget’s suggestion, wrote to six members of the Privy Council,
introducing the subject of the treaty. Then, seeing that all
further opposition would be fruitless, the Chancellor, ever
patriotic, consented to negotiate terms likely to safeguard the
rights, liberties and interests of the nation.</p>

<p>There remained only for the Emperor to make the formal
demand for Mary’s hand, on behalf of his son.</p>

Bonner had been sent to prison for what he had failed to say in a sermon
at Paul’s Cross, namely, that “the king’s authority was as great during the
minority as if he were thirty or forty years old,” a doctrine which the Council
had ordered him to preach. He obeyed on all other points, but passed this one
over in silence. Hooper and Latimer laid information against him; he was
examined on seven different days before Cranmer, and was in the end deprived
and thrown into prison, to remain there perpetually at the King’s, in other words,
the Council’s, pleasure (<i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>, Art. “Edmund
Bonner”).</p></div>

now becomes one of the chief authorities for this part of the reign, discovered, in
the middle of the last century, a number of Renard’s despatches in the royal
library at Besançon, and wrote, in answer to David Hume’s gross libel and

at Amsterdam in 1765. Its title, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nouveaux Eclaircissements sur le règne de

When Mary told Gardiner that she would never marry Courtenay, the
Chancellor replied with tears, owning that he had entertained an affection for
the young man from the time of their mutual imprisonment. Mary then
asked him whether it was proper for her to marry him just because her
Chancellor was fond of him in prison (Renard to the Emperor, Record Office
Transcripts).</p></div>

She charged Renard to inform Mary that it had been painted three years
previously, and that, like all Titian’s works, it required to be studied at a little
distance, in order to perceive the likeness. She added, that since it had been executed,
Philip had matured and had grown more beard. About this time, Cardinal
Granvelle sent the painter, Antonio More, to England to paint Mary’s portrait
for Philip. She sat to him at different times, and he painted several fine
portraits of her. The principal one is at Madrid, in the Museo del Prado.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Courtenay</span> was still on the horns of a dilemma, where the
weakness and natural timidity of his character kept him
irresolute. While he did not hesitate to play with treason,
listening to the French ambassador’s flattering suggestions
that he should marry Elizabeth, set up his standard in the
south-west, and gather round it the disaffected, he hesitated,
in the faint hope that the Queen might yet raise him by a
safer path to the throne. Never was ambition supported by
less courage, moral or physical. De Noailles was in despair
as much on account of Courtenay’s want of decision as because
of his loose conduct.<a name="FNanchor_378_378"
id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>It had cost Paget and Renard much trouble to persuade
Mary to simulate a belief, which she was now far from entertaining,
in Elizabeth’s loyalty. But at last, her sister’s
collusion with traitors could no longer be ignored, and remembering
all that she had suffered at the hands of Anne
Boleyn, the Queen would have been credulous indeed, if she
had continued to place confidence in Anne Boleyn’s daughter.<a name="FNanchor_379_379"
id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
The awakening had involved a shock, but Renard and the
Spanish party in the Council, consisting of the Duke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Norfolk, the Earl of Arundel and Lord Paget, prevailed on
her to control her indignation, in order to pave the way for
her marriage; and it is probable that the idea, which now
suggested itself to the Queen and Paget, of marrying Elizabeth
to Courtenay,<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380"
class="fnanchor">[380]</a> originated in the wish to propitiate those who
were opposed to the Spanish match. Half the objection to
the Queen’s union with a foreigner would, they thought,
vanish, if it were clearly understood, that in the event of her
death without issue, not Philip of Spain, but the English heirs
of Elizabeth and Courtenay would succeed to the throne. It
was a strange coincidence that the same idea should have
occurred both to the Queen and her friends, and to her
bitterest foe the French ambassador. He thought thereby
to create a strong party for Elizabeth and Courtenay, while
the loyalists hoped to put an end to the discontent. But the
Emperor, to whom of course the plan was at once referred,
nipped it in the bud. He saw that to promote such a marriage
would be suicidal, for it would constitute the contracting parties
natural heads of the conspiracy, and furnish them with a strong
motive for plotting against the Queen’s life.<a name="FNanchor_381_381"
id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth, who was now at Hatfield, and eager to prove
the sincerity of her conversion, wrote to her sister for copes,
chasubles and everything necessary for Catholic worship in
her chapel; but it was remarked that she surrounded herself
exclusively with those of the new doctrines, and that she was
considerably hampered by the constant supervision under
which she lived. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Toutefois, je vous laisse à penser Sire</span>,”
wrote de Noailles, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si ladite dame Elisabeth est en peyne
d’estre si près éclairée</span> (watched) c<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">e qui n’est fait sans
quelque raison, car je vous puis asseurer Sire, qu’elle désire
fort de se mettre hors de tutelle, et à ce que j’entends, il ne

ne le suive jusques au pays de Dampschier (Devonshire) et

est en si grande craincte, qu’il n’ose rien entreprendre.

<p>On the 2nd January 1554, the imperial envoys, Counts Egmont
and Lalain, Jean de Montmorency, Lord of Corrières,
and the Sieur de Nigry, Chancellor of the Order of the Golden
Fleece, arrived in England, “for the knitting up of the marriage
of the Queen to the King of Spain, before whose landing
there was let off a great peal of guns in the Tower”. At the
Tower wharf they were met by Sir Anthony Browne, “he being
clothed in a very gorgeous apparel,” and on Tower Hill, the
Earl of Devon, and others received them, “in most honourable
and familiar wise”. Courtenay gave his right hand to Count
Egmont, “and brought him throughout Cheapside, and so
forth to Westminster; the people nothing rejoicing held down
their heads sorrowfully. The day before his coming in, as his
retinue and harbingers came riding through London, the boys
pelted them with snowballs, so hateful was the sight of their
coming in to them.”<a name="FNanchor_383_383"
id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The Council and the municipality of London did their
best to counteract the impression conveyed by the attitude
of the people, and the next day, the Lord Mayor and the
Lord Chamberlain waited on the envoys, and presented them
with various rich gifts. On the 9th, they were invited to a
banquet given by the Lords of the Privy Council. On the
10th they went to Hampton Court.<a name="FNanchor_384_384"
id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384"
class="fnanchor">[384]</a> In an audience, at which
the whole court was present, they formally demanded Mary’s
hand for the Prince of Spain. The Queen replied, that it
became not a woman to speak in public, on so delicate a
matter as her own marriage, but that they might confer with
her ministers, who would make known to them her resolution;
but, fixing her eyes on the ring that had been placed on her
finger at her coronation, she told the envoys to bear in mind
that her realm was her first husband, and that no consideration
would induce her to violate the faith she had already pledged.<a name="FNanchor_385_385"
id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>The terms of the marriage treaty, which had already been
settled between Gardiner and Renard, were in every way most
honourable to the English nation, safeguarding the national
interests in a manner far beyond all other royal marriage
treaties before or since. It was stipulated, that Philip should
observe strictly the rights and privileges of all classes, and
that foreigners should be excluded from public offices; that
he should have no claim on English ships, ammunition or
treasure, that he should not involve the country in the war
which he and the Emperor were carrying on against Henry
II., and that as far as lay in his power, he would promote
peace between England and France.<a name="FNanchor_386_386"
id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386"
class="fnanchor">[386]</a> If there were issue
of the marriage, the eldest child was to inherit Burgundy
and the Low Countries, a valuable appanage to the Crown of
England; and if the Queen predeceased her husband, Philip
was to resign the guardianship of the child into English hands.
Moreover, this child, male or female, was also, in the event
of the death without issue of Don Carlos, Philip’s son by his
first marriage, to inherit the kingdoms of Spain and Sicily,
the Duchy of Milan, and all Philip’s other dominions. Sixty
thousand pounds a year (equal to about a million of present
money) was to be settled on Mary as her jointure, to be paid
by Spain, if she outlived her husband. Besides this, she was
to share with him equally all his titles, honours and dignities,
which were to be mentioned in all official documents, after
their first titles of King and Queen of England.<a name="FNanchor_387_387"
id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>No political combination could have been more advantageous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
to England as a make-weight against the marriage
of Mary Queen of Scots with the Dauphin. For it was not
only <i>desirable</i> that England should seek the protection of the
Empire against this important coalition, but as Elizabeth had
been virtually declared illegitimate by two Acts of Parliament,
Mary Stuart was heir presumptive to the throne,
and it was <i>necessary</i> to raise an effectual barrier against
the possibility of England becoming a mere appendage to
France.</p>

<p>Philip was to have nothing but the empty title of King,
the only advantages accruing to him from the marriage being
the geographical position of England, its political friendship
as a counterpoise to the alliance between France and Scotland,
and the hope that Mary would give birth to an heir.
By the first he would secure an unmolested passage through
the English Channel, for his ships sailing between Spain and
the Netherlands; by the second the balance of power in Europe
would be restored, and by the third he would checkmate his
enemy. Further than this he would reap no benefit. England,
with the exception of London, was poor, and only just
recovering from the consequences of a debased currency,
while the religious troubles of the last seventeen years,
dating from the Pilgrimage of Grace, had made revolt and
popular risings far too frequent for the prosperity of the
country.</p>

<p>During the first half of the sixteenth century, England had
played but a subordinate part in the politics of Europe, and
during Edward’s reign, the Government had been so weak
that Charles V. had been able to demand Mary’s religious
rights without compromise. France and the Empire had disputed
the honours, the wealth, the prestige of the civilised
world, and Mary had some reason to hope that by her marriage,
she would raise her country to the rank of a first-rate
power. But de Noailles and his friends had sown the seeds
of discord too carefully, party and religious feeling ran too
high for dispassionate counsels to prevail, and when, on the
14th and 15th January, the Chancellor read aloud the articles
of the treaty, first in the Upper, then in the Lower House,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
calling attention in each, to the favourable terms stipulated
for, and to the provisions made to secure the national independence,
no satisfaction was expressed.<a name="FNanchor_388_388"
id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388"
class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Immediately afterwards,
the French King ordered his ambassador to demand
an audience, and to represent to Mary his master’s grief at her
projected union with his enemy, “having desired more than
anything in this world, to perpetuate friendship with her all
their lives”. Nevertheless, Henry wanted not peace, but
England as well as Scotland, for his daughter-in-law’s dowry,
for together, France, England and Scotland would have
formed a compact bulwark against the Empire. Spain and
the Netherlands would have been completely sundered, with
no possibility of intercourse, and the Low Countries would
have fallen a facile prey to France.<a name="FNanchor_389_389"
id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389"
class="fnanchor">[389]</a> At the very time when
he was charging his ambassador to reproach the Queen with a
want of friendship, de Noailles was secretly interviewing a
number of the malcontents, and organising a plot so widespread
in its ramifications, that had it succeeded, Mary must have been
utterly undone. Devonshire and Cornwall were to rise under
Sir Peter Carew, in favour of Elizabeth and Courtenay; Sir
Thomas Wyatt, a young Kentish gentleman, son of the poet
of that name, was to disaffect the home counties. The Duke
of Suffolk was to incite to rebellion his tenantry in the Midlands;
Sir James Croft undertook to cause a revolt on the
borders of Wales, while the French fleet was under orders to be
in readiness to help the insurgents wherever the need should
be greatest. De Selve, formerly French ambassador in England,
now envoy at Venice, wrote to the Constable of France,
advising him to do his utmost to stir up and keep alive the
discontent in England. This was done by circulating the
grossest and most self-contradictory falsehoods. It was reported
that Edward was still alive, that the Spaniards were
coming with an army of 8,000 men to take possession of the
Tower, the ports and the ships, that they possessed every
vice and evil propensity that could enslave and disgrace a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
nation, that the Queen had been false to her promises not
to make any change in religion or to marry a foreigner.<a name="FNanchor_390_390"
id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
Had there been unity of purpose and design among the
leaders, and above all, had Courtenay possessed one spark of
courage, their success would have been certain. But some
were for immediate action, while others had regard to the bad
and almost impassable state of the country roads, and to the
difficulty of a combined movement in mid-winter.</p>

<p>Finally, it was decided that nothing should be done till the
spring, when Philip was expected to arrive. At the first sign
of his approach, they were to arm, oppose his landing, marry
Elizabeth to Courtenay, and have them proclaimed King and
Queen in Devonshire. But the suspicions of the Council
were roused by the visits to Elizabeth of a mysterious person,
representing himself to be a French pastor. He had several
conferences with her, the officers of her household taking him
for an emissary of the disaffected. The Council urged Mary
to secure Elizabeth’s person, but in vain, and Gardiner sent a
message to the Princess, entreating her to be loyal to the
Queen.<a name="FNanchor_391_391"
id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391"
class="fnanchor">[391]</a> Elizabeth immediately posed as a victim, but Courtenay
was wax in the Chancellor’s hands. Gardiner summoned
him to an interview, and began by reproaching the thankless
recipient of Mary’s bounty with his manner of life, and with
the company he frequented, warning him that if he continued
to forget his duty to the Queen, he would assuredly have
cause for repentance. He should be on his guard, the
Chancellor insinuated, against the French, and other interested
people, adding that her Majesty wished that he should go and
make the acquaintance of the Emperor. Hereupon Courtenay
became alarmed, fancying himself already handed over to the
just punishment of his crime. He pretended to confess all,
declared that certain persons had tried to persuade him of
things touching religion and the Queen’s marriage, but that
he had been unwilling to listen to them; that he had resolved
to live and die in the Queen’s service; that a marriage with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Madam Elizabeth had been proposed to him, but that he
would rather be sent back to the Tower than be united to her;
and that he was willing to accept the proposed mission to the
Low Countries.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392"
class="fnanchor">[392]</a> This was all that Renard committed to
writing of the interview, but the news spread like wildfire
among the conspirators, that Courtenay had revealed the plot,
and de Noailles informed Henry of the fact. Renard as usual
importuned Gardiner for Elizabeth’s imprisonment, but the
Chancellor made an evasive answer, to the effect that he would
see to it when the Prince of Spain should be in England.
The plotters decided to bring matters to an immediate crisis,
although it was fully six weeks before the time fixed for
action. On leaving London, Wyatt and Croft resolved to
warn Elizabeth, but the letter which Wyatt wrote to her fell
into the hands of the Council. In this letter, he urged her for
greater safety to leave her house at Ashridge, and to retire to
her castle of Donnington, thirty miles farther from the capital.
On the day after Wyatt’s appearance openly in arms at Maidstone,
the Queen wrote to Elizabeth:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Right dear and entirely beloved Sister, We greet you
well: And where certain evil-disposed persons minding more
the satisfaction of their own malicious and seditious minds,
than their duty of allegiance towards us, have of late foully
spread divers lewd and untrue rumours; and by that means
and other devilish practices, do travail to induce our good and
loving subjects to an unnatural rebellion against God, us and
the tranquillity of our realm, we tendering the surety of your
person, which might chance to be in some peril, if any sudden
tumult should arise, where you now be, or about Donnington,
whither, as we understand, you are minded shortly to remove,
do therefore think expedient, you should put yourself in good
readiness, with all convenient speed, to make your repair
hither to us. Which we pray you, fail not to do; assuring
you, that as you may most surely remain here, so shall you
be most heartily welcome to us. And of your mind herein
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
we pray you to return answer by this messenger. And thus
we pray God to have you in his holy keeping.</p>

<p>“Given under our signet, at our manor of St. James’s, the
26 Jan. in the first year of our reign.</p>

<p><span style="padding-left:40%;">“Your loving sister</span></p>
<p class="ar">“<span class="smcap">Marye the Queen</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_393_393"
id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
</p></div>
<p>Elizabeth returned a verbal answer, saying that she was
too ill to travel at that time, but that she would come as soon
as she was able. She neither removed to Donnington, in compliance
with Wyatt’s letter and Croft’s reiterated entreaties,
nor made any attempt to obey Mary’s summons, but fortified
herself at Ashridge, and took to her bed, either because she
was really ill, or to give some colour to her assertion. De
Noailles told Henry II. that she had surrounded herself with
people “à sa devotion,” and was suspected. Renard also noted
that she had summoned armed men to her defence.<a name="FNanchor_394_394"
id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394"
class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>The Earl of Devon remained at court closely watched,
presenting a pitiable figure, but stoutly maintaining his loyalty
and devotion to the Queen.</p>

<p>In spite of the determination, boldness and assurance with
which the plot had been laid, the conspirators were mistaken
in the measure of the national discontent. Even the Devonshire
men, supposed to be staunch adherents of Courtenay’s
house, were apathetic, and when it became apparent that the
young Earl would fail to come himself and lead them, their
last spark of enthusiasm died out. The Earl of Bedford, who
was sent against them, took a few of the leaders prisoners,
Carew with some of his companions escaping to France. Sir
James Croft was closely pursued, when he left London to
spread revolt among his tenantry on the banks of the Severn,
and before one seditious word could be uttered, his designs
were nipped in the bud. He was arrested in his bed and
conveyed to the Tower.</p>

<p>The part taken by the Duke of Suffolk was particularly
odious. If he displayed a less craven spirit than Courtenay,
his ingratitude for past favours was far more glaring. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
principal mover after Northumberland, in the plot to deprive
Mary of the Crown, he had been freely and frankly forgiven,
after only three days’ imprisonment, being permitted to suffer
for his treason neither in body nor estate. So great moreover
was the distinction accorded to his wife by Mary, that the
Queen sometimes gave her precedence over her own sister;
and if his daughter and her husband were still captives, it was
owing to the fact of the disturbed state of London, and its
neighbourhood, the direct result of his own and his friends’
treachery. There is little doubt that there had been no
further movement to raise the Lady Jane to the throne,
and had her father remained faithful, although sentence of
death had been passed on her, she would shortly with her
husband have regained complete liberty. None suspected
Suffolk’s fidelity, for with consummate deceit, the Duke feigned
the deepest attachment to the person of the Queen, giving
repeated assurances of the same, and of his approval of her
marriage. So entirely was Mary deceived, that it was thought
she contemplated placing him at the head of her troops.<a name="FNanchor_395_395"
id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> The
following account of his departure for the Midlands shows
how little she doubted him:—</p>

<p>“The 25th day of January, the Duke of Suffolk, the lord
John Gray and the Lord Leonard Gray fled (from his house
at Sheen). It is said that the same morning that he was
going, there came a messenger to him from the Queen, that
he should come to the Court. ‘Marry,’ quoth he, ‘I was
coming to her Grace. Ye may see, I am booted and spurred,
ready to ride, and I will but break my fast and go.’ So he
gave the messenger a reward, and caused him to be made
to drink, and so thence departed himself, no man knoweth
whither. Sir Thomas Palmer, servant to the Earl of Arundel
said on the morrow following, to a friend of his, that the complot
between the French king and the said Duke of Suffolk
was now come to light.”<a name="FNanchor_396_396"
id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>Suffolk went into Warwickshire with his brothers, and
about fifty followers, and was accused of having proclaimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the Lady Jane at Leicester, and in other places, but according
to Holinshed, he only called on the inhabitants of the towns
through which he passed, to rise and fight for their liberties,
which were at the mercy of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_397_397"
id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
But as in the first
rebellion, the people listened to him in stolid and indifferent
silence, even refusing the money which he scattered in profusion
among them. The Earl of Huntingdon, who was
sent in pursuit as soon as Suffolk’s intentions were known,
encountered the Duke near Coventry, and after a slight
skirmish obliged him to fly for his life. He was betrayed
by one of his own tenants, with whom he had taken refuge,
and delivered over to his pursuers.</p>

<p>Thus the triple cord was utterly broken in less than a
fortnight, and Mary and her advisers might now concentrate
all their energies on the only one of the chief plotters who
seemed likely to prove dangerous. This was Sir Thomas
Wyatt, whose name has become identified with the rebellion.
In courage, skill and enterprise he far exceeded the other
conspirators, and when it was known that he had risen,
furnished with arms and ammunition by the Venetian ambassador,
consternation filled the hearts of the loyal. Fifteen
thousand Kentish men gathered round his standard, in the
fields bordering the great highway that runs from London to
Dover. They harassed the Flemish and Spanish merchants,
travelling from the coast inland, in such sort, that those who
escaped with their lives thought themselves fortunate.</p>

<p>So great was the terror which he inspired, that if Wyatt
had at once pushed on to London, the city would have fallen
resistless into his hands.</p>

<p>“The 26th day of January,” says Machyn, “began watching
at every gate, in harness, for tidings came the same time to
the Queen and her Council, that Sir Thomas Wyatt, Sir
George Harper, Sir Hare Isseley, Master Cobham, and
Master Rudston and Master Knevett, and divers other gentlemen
and commons were up, and they say because [of] the
Prince of Spain coming in to have our Queen, for they keep
Rochester Castle, and the bridge and other places.”<a name="FNanchor_398_398"
id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>By six o’clock in the evening, a small force of about five
hundred men had been collected at Leadenhall, and the next
day marched towards Gravesend, under Captain Brett, as if
to fight the Kentish men, while the Earl of Huntingdon set
out with another company “to take the Duke of Suffolk”.
The Duke of Norfolk, lieutenant of the army, was supported
by the Earl of Ormond, and Sir Henry Jerningham, Captain
of the Guard, with a considerable number of men under him.
But the loyalty of Brett and his men was feigned, and the
following account relates the story of their treason:—</p>

<p>“And before the setting forward of these men, the Duke
sent a herald into Rochester, with the Queen’s proclamation,
that all such as would desist their purpose should have frank
and free pardon; who came upon the bridge, and would have
gone through into the city, but they that kept the bridge
would not suffer him, till that the captain came, who at last
granted the same to be read in the city. But the same being
ended, each man cried they had done nothing whereof they
should need any pardon, and that quarrel which they took,
they would die and live in it. Nevertheless, at the last, Sir
George Harper received the pardon outwardly, and being
received under the Duke of Norfolk’s protection, came on forward
against the Kentish men; and even as the company was
set in a readiness, and marched forward toward the bridge,
the said Bret being captain of the five hundred Londoners, of
which the more part were in the forward, turned himself
about, and drawing his sword said by report these or much
like words. ‘Masters, we go about to fight against our native
countrymen of England and our friends, in a quarrel unrightful
and partly wicked, for they, considering the great and
manifold miseries which are like to fall upon us if we shall be
under the rule of the proud Spaniards or strangers, are here
assembled to make resistance against the coming in of him or
his favourers.’”</p>

<p>Then followed the usual highly coloured description of
the state of slavery to which England was to be reduced by
the Queen’s marriage, a picture that had been so often held
up before the people by de Noailles, that it was no wonder if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
they had come to believe in the reality of the horrors portrayed.
“‘Wherefore,’ continued Brett, ‘I and these (meaning
by them such as were in that rank with him) will spend our
blood in the quarrel of this worthy captain, master Wyatt,
and other gentlemen here assembled.’ Which words once
pronounced, each man turned their ordnance against their
fellow. The Londoners thereupon cried ‘a Wyatt! a Wyatt!’
of which sudden noise, the duke, the earl of Ormond and
the captain of the guard, being abashed, fled forthwith. Immediately
came in master Wyatt and his company, on horseback,
rushing in amongst them, saying as well to the guard,
Londoners, as to all the rest. ‘So many as will come and
tarry with us shall be welcome; and so many as will depart,
good leave have they.’ And so all the Londoners, part of
the guard, and more than three parts of the retinue went into
the camp of the Kentishmen, where they still remain. At
this discomfiture, the Duke lost eight pieces of brass, with all
other munition and ordnance, and himself with the earl of
Ormond, and Jerningham and others fled to London. Ye
should have seen some of the guard come home, their coats
turned, all ruined, without arrows or string in their bow, or
sword, in a very strange wise; which discomfiture, like as it
was a heartsore, and very displeasing to the Queen and
Council, even so it was almost no less joyous to the Londoners,
and most part of all others.”<a name="FNanchor_399_399"
id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Wyatt then marched to a house belonging to Lord Cobham
near Rochester, made himself master of it, and obliged
the owner with his two sons to join his band. His next
movement was towards London. The Queen ordered the
bridges over the Thames to be destroyed, to the distance of
fifteen miles. The numbers of the insurgents increased daily,
lashed into a fury of fear by inflammatory words, such as the
following incident relates:—</p>

<p>William Cotman, afterwards committed, declared that
“William Ishley Gent. eldest son Sir William Ishley, Knt.,
came this morning to his shop, two hours before day, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
shoe his horse, where he tarried the making of a shoe, and
there used these words: ‘that the Spaniards were coming into
the realm, with harness and hand-guns, and would make us
Englishmen worse than enemies and viler; for this realm
should be brought to such bondage by them, as it was never
afore, but should be utterly conquered!’ And at his taking
of his horse, he said with a loud voice, that all the street
might hear it, it being scarce day: ‘Smith, if thou beest a
good fellow, stir and encourage all the neighbours to rise
against these strangers, for they should have lawful warning
and help enough!...’ ‘Why,’ quoth the smith, ‘these be
marvellous words, for we shall be hanged if we stir.’ ‘No,’
quoth Ishley, ‘ye shall have help enough, for the people are
already up in Devonshire and Cornwall, Hampshire and other
counties.’”<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400"
class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>

<p>The Council, the Court, the loyal citizens of London were
panic-stricken, armed men patrolled the London streets;
friends and foes were scarcely to be distinguished in the surging,
vociferous crowds that thronged the open spaces day and
night. Confusion and terror reigned. The government sued
Wyatt for terms, thereby only increasing his audacity. He
replied by undertaking to lay down his arms, provided that
the Queen placed the Tower of London, and four of her principal
advisers in his hands, as guarantees of her promise to
marry an Englishman. Mutual distrust gave rise to futile
recriminations at the Council Board. Gardiner was reproached
on the one hand for his precipitancy in restoring the ancient
religion; the Spanish ambassadors, on the other, were blamed
for advising the Queen’s marriage with Philip, to which the
Chancellor had always been opposed. The ambassadors fled
in dismay, disguised as merchants—all but Renard, who refused
to desert the Queen.</p>

<p>Mary was at Whitehall and Westminster Palace, during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the whole time of the horrible panic, the only calm and self-possessed
figure, amid the confusion and dire distress of her
friends. She could easily pass from one palace to the other
by means of the inside galleries which connected the Holbein
Gate at Whitehall, with the Old Palace at Westminster, on the
site of the present Houses of Parliament. When her ministers
urged her to seek safety in flight, she as usual consulted
Renard, who advised her to remain, if she would not lose her
crown.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401"
class="fnanchor">[401]</a> A meeting of the citizens to discuss measures for the
defence of London, was convened at the Guildhall, on the 1st
February. Mary’s coming to the city and her address to the
people are thus described by Wriothesley:—</p>

<p>“The same day in the afternoon, being Candlemas Even,
all the Commons of the City were assembled in their liveries
at the Guildhall. The Queen’s Majesty, with her lords and
ladies, riding from Westminster to the said Guildhall, came
thither by 3 of the clock the same afternoon. First she went
up to the Council Chamber, where the aldermen use to sit, and
there paused a little, the Lord Mayor and aldermen receiving
her Majesty at the steps going up to the Lord Mayor’s Court.
Then her Majesty came down into the great hall, up into the
place of the hustings, where was hanged a rich cloth of estate,
she standing under it, with her own mouth declared to the
audience there assembled, the wicked pretence of the traitor
Wyatt, which was utterly to deprive her of her crown and to
spoil the City; which was so nobly and with so good spirit
declared, and with so loud a voice, that all the people might
hear her Majesty, and comforting their hearts with so sweet
words, that made them weep for joy to hear her Majesty speak.
This done, she came down, and went up again into the Council
Chamber, and drank, and then departed, and rode through
Bucklersbury to the Crane in the Vinetree, and there took her
barge, and so to Westminster by water.”<a name="FNanchor_402_402"
id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>Foxe gives the Queen’s speech at the Guildhall “as near
out of her own mouth as it could be penned”. She said:
“I am come unto you in mine own person to tell you that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
which already you see and know; that is, how traitorously and
rebelliously a number of Kentishmen have assembled themselves
against us and you. Their pretence (as they said at
the first) was for a marriage determined for us, to the which,
and to all the articles thereof, ye have been made privy. But
since, we have caused certain of our privy council to go again
unto them, and to demand the cause of this their rebellion;
and it appeared then unto our said council, that the matter
of the marriage seemed to be but a Spanish cloak to cover
their pretended purpose against our religion; for that they
arrogantly and traitorously demanded to have the governance
of our person, the keeping of the Tower, and the placing of
our councillors. Now, loving subjects, what I am ye right
well know. I am your queen, to whom at my coronation,
when I was wedded to the realm and laws of the same (the
spousal ring whereof I have on my finger, which never hitherto
was, nor hereafter shall be left off) you promised your allegiance
and obedience unto me. And that I am the right and
true inheritor of the crown of this realm of England, I take all
Christendom to witness. My father, as ye all know, possessed
the same regal state, which now rightly is descended unto me:
and to him always ye showed yourselves most faithful and
loving subjects; and therefore I doubt not, but ye will show
yourselves [such] likewise unto me, and that ye will not suffer
a vile traitor to have the order and governance of our person,
and to occupy our estate, especially being so vile a traitor as
Wyat is, who most certainly as he hath abused mine ignorant
subjects which be on his side, so doth he intend and purpose
the destruction of you, and spoil of your goods. And I say
to you on the word of a prince, I cannot tell how naturally the
mother loveth the child, for I was never the mother of any,
but certainly if a prince and governor may as naturally and
earnestly love her subjects, as the mother doth love the child,
then assure yourselves that I, being your lady and mistress, do
as earnestly and tenderly love and favour you. And I, thus
loving you, cannot but think that ye as heartily and faithfully
love me; and then I doubt not but that we shall give these
rebels a short and speedy overthrow. As concerning the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
marriage, ye shall understand that I enterprised not the doing
thereof without advice, and that by the advice of all our privy
council, who so considered and weighed the great commodities
that might ensue thereof, that they not only thought it
very honourable, but also expedient, both for the wealth of the
realm, and also of you our subjects. And as touching myself,
I assure you, I am not so bent to my will, neither so precise
nor affectionate, that either for mine own pleasure I would choose
where I lust, or that I am so desirous, as needs I would have
one. For God, I thank him, to whom be the praise therefore,
I have hitherto lived a virgin, and doubt nothing, but with
God’s grace, I am able so to live still. But if, as my progenitors
have done before me, it may please God, that I might
leave some fruit of my body behind me, to be your governor,
I trust you would not only rejoice thereat, but also I know it
would be to your great comfort. And certainly, if I either did
think or know, that this marriage were to the hurt of any of
you my commons, or to the impeachment of any part or
parcel of the royal state of this realm of England, I would
never consent thereunto, neither would I ever marry while I
lived. And on the word of a queen, I promise you, that if it
shall not probably appear to all the nobility and commons, in
the high court of parliament, that this marriage shall be for the
high benefit and commodity of the whole realm, then will I
abstain from marriage while I live. And now good subjects,
pluck up your hearts, and like true men, stand fast against
these rebels, both our enemies and yours, and fear them not,
for I assure you I fear them nothing at all. And I will leave
with you, my lord Howard, and my lord treasurer, who shall
be assistants with the mayor for your defence.”<a name="FNanchor_403_403"
id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<p>As Mary finished this oration, “which she seemed perfectly
to have conned without book,” the hall resounded with
cheers and acclamations. “God save Queen Mary!” shouted
the citizens, and some even added, “and the Prince of Spain”.
The Chancellor, who was standing by, exclaimed:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> “Oh, how
happy are we, to whom God hath given such a wise and
learned prince!” Enthusiasm took the place of depression,
and 20,000 men at once enrolled themselves for the defence.
The Queen’s noble confidence in the strength and righteousness
of her cause communicated itself to the people, and the
approach of the rebels was henceforth met with steady preparations
for a determined resistance. On the last day of
January, Wyatt was at Dartford. While Mary was rousing
the citizens to fervour at the Guildhall, he was passing through
Greenwich and Deptford, but his company was suffering hourly
from desertions, and that same night Lord Cobham gave himself
up, and was taken to the Tower as a prisoner.</p>

<p>“On Saturday in the morning, being the 3rd of February,
there came forth a proclamation, set forth by the Queen’s
Council, wherein was declared that that traitor Wyatt educed
simple people against the Queen. Wherefore, she willed all
her loving subjects to endeavour themselves to withstand
him; and that the Duke of Suffolk with his two brethren
were discomfited by the Earl of Huntingdon, and certain of
his horsemen taken, and the Duke and his two brethren fled
in servingman’s coats; and that Sir Peter Carew was fled into
France; and that Sir Gawen Carew, Gibbs and others were
taken and remain in Exeter; and that the whole city of
Exeter and commons thereabout, were at the Queen’s commandment,
with their power to the death. And that she did
pardon the whole camp except Wyatt, Harper, Rudston and
Iseley; and that whoever could take Wyat, except the said
four persons, should have an hundred pounds a year, to them
and to their heirs for ever.”<a name="FNanchor_404_404"
id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless Wyatt pushed on boldly, in spite of his daily
decreasing numbers, and the disorganised state of his band,
weary with trudging day after day along the miry high-roads,
exposed to the inclemency of the prolonged winter. He
reached Southwark, which he ravaged during four terrible
days, seeking how he might cross the river and capture
London. But the bridge had been hewn down, and he was
obliged, after his men had pillaged Gardiner’s house, and destroyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
his library, “so that a man might have gone up to the
knees in the leaves of books cut out and thrown under feet,”<a name="FNanchor_405_405"
id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
to move out of the reach of the batteries placed on the Tower
walls. He marched up to Kingston, where he effected a
crossing. Here also the bridge had been partially destroyed,
but he swam over the Thames, and procured a boat, in which
he, with a few others, worked so successfully at its restoration
that by eleven o’clock at night his 7,000 men were able to
pass over it. The audacity of the feat filled London once
more with consternation. Gardiner threw himself on his
knees, and entreated Mary to retire into the Tower for
safety. She replied, that if the Earl of Pembroke and Lord
Clinton, who had charge of the defence, would do their duty,
she would assuredly remain at her post. But she was the
only calm person in the whole panic-stricken palace. “The
Queen’s ladies,” said Underhill,<a name="FNanchor_406_406"
id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
“made the greatest lamentations
that night; they wept and wrung their hands, and from
their exclamations may be judged the state of the interior of
Whitehall. Alack! alack! they said, some great mischief is
toward. We shall all be destroyed this night. What a sight
is this, to see the queen’s bedchamber full of armed men!
The like was never seen or heard before!”</p>

<p>The struggle began at four o’clock in the morning (7th
February), and all through the day, Mary’s presence animated
the courage of the soldiers, and restored the confidence of the
citizens; for “it was more than marvel to see that day the
invincible heart and constancy of the queen”.<a name="FNanchor_407_407"
id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The way in
which these were displayed adds to the force of the picture.
Mary might well have ridden up and down the ranks, speaking
gracious words, or have herself led her soldiers to battle.
She chose a more womanly way. “The Queen,” says Bishop
Christopherson, “while the field was fighting, was fervently
occupied in praying. And when as tidings was brought her
that by treason all was lost, she like a valiant champion of
Christ, nothing abashed therewith, said that she doubted not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
at all, but her Captain (meaning thereby our Saviour Jesus
Christ) would have the victory at length. And falling to her
prayer again, anon after, had she word brought her that her
men had won the field, and that Wyatt, her enemy’s captain
was taken.”<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408"
class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>The story of that memorable day has been often told.
Wyatt arrived near the spot now covered by St. George’s
Hospital, at Hyde Park Corner, at about nine o’clock in the
morning, and set up his standard in a field. The numbers of
his Kentish yeomanry, and burghers of Maidstone, Canterbury
and Rochester, had still further diminished during the
past night, many being glad to avail themselves of the pardon
extended to them in the Queen’s proclamation. Those who
still remained lost heart, when they saw the preparations that
had been made to receive them. Ten thousand infantry, fifteen
hundred mounted troops, and a formidable battery of
cannon, lay between the insurgents and the gates of the city.
Wyatt, valiant to the last, resolved to fight his way through,
in the hope of being succoured by his friends within the walls.
The ranks of the Queen’s soldiers opened to let him pass, with
about four hundred of his men, then closed again, and having
separated the leader from the main body of his army, fell upon
the wavering lines, and cut them to pieces. Nearly five hundred
of them were made prisoners, many were wounded, and
about a hundred were slain. Wyatt with his four hundred
men was allowed to proceed unchallenged. Halting at St.
James’s, to insult the gates of the palace, he then passed on
towards Charing Cross, where he encountered Sir John Gage,
with a detachment of the Queen’s Guards, and a number of
gentlemen. Among them was Courtenay. Either from fear,
or with treacherous intent, at sight of Wyatt, he fled in the
direction of Whitehall, crying “All is lost!” Lord Worcester
and the Guards followed helter skelter, taking up the cry, and
causing a fresh panic, which was increased when they met a
company of Wyatt’s soldiers in search of their leader. These
let fly a shower of arrows into the palace windows, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
those within thought that an attack was being made. But
the Queen, indifferent to danger, came out on to a balcony
and cried that she was ready to descend into the arena, and
to die with those who remained faithful to her.</p>

<p>Wyatt had by this time, reached Ludgate, ignorant that
his greatest opportunity lay behind him. Had he retraced
his steps, pursued Courtenay and the Guards, he would have
rejoined his men, and could easily have captured the Queen.
But in the meanwhile, he had suffered under the fire of
another detachment of Guards, which the Earl of Pembroke
was sending to Mary’s assistance, and his followers, fagged and
spiritless, numbered barely three hundred, when he knocked
at Ludgate for admittance.</p>

<p>His demand to be let in, on the lying ground that “the
Queen had granted all his petitions,” was met by the defiant
answer of Lord William Howard, “Avaunt traitor, thou
shalt not come in here!” “And then,” continues the Chronicle,
“Wyat awhile stayed, and as some say, rested him upon a
seat [at] the Bellsavage gate; at last seeing he could not
come in, and belike being deceived of the aid which he hoped
out of the city, returned back again in array towards Charing
Cross, and was never stopped till he came to Temple Bar,
where certain horsemen which came from the field met them
in the face; and then began the fight again to wax hot, till
an herald said to master Wyat, ‘Sir, ye were best, by my
counsel, to yield. You see this day is gone against you, and
in resisting ye can get no good, but be the death of all these
your soldiers, to your great peril of soul. Perchance ye may
find the Queen merciful, and the rather if ye stint so great
a bloodshed as is like here to be.’ Wyat herewith being
somewhat astonished (although he saw his men bent to fight
it out to the death) said ‘Well, if I shall needs yield, I will
yield me to a gentleman’. To whom Sir Morice Barkeley
came straight up, and bade him leap up behind him; and
another took Thomas Cobham, and William Knevet, and
so carried them behind them upon their horses to the court.
Then was taking of men on all sides. It is said that in this
conflict, one pikeman setting his back to the wall at Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
James, kept seventeen horsemen off him a great time, and at
last was slain. At this battle, was slain in the field, by estimation
on both sides, not past forty persons, as far as could be
learned by certain that viewed the same; but there was many
sore hurt, and some think there was many slain in houses.
The noise of women and children, when the conflict was at
Charing Cross, was so great and shrill, that it was heard to the
top of the White tower; and also the great shot was well discerned
there out of Saint James’ field. There stood upon the
leads there the lord Marquess [of Northampton], Sir Nicholas
Poyns, Sir Thomas Pope, Master John Seamer and others.
From the battle, when one came and brought word that the
Queen was like to have the victory, and that the horsemen
had discomfited the tale of his enemies, the lord Marquess
for joy gave the messenger ten shillings in gold, and fell in
great rejoicing. Note that when Wyat was perceived to be
comen to Ludgate, and the mayor and his brethren heard
thereof, thinking all had not gone well with the Queen’s side,
they were much amazed, and stood as men half out of their
lives, and many hollow hearts rejoiced in London at the
same.”<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409"
class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<p>According to another account, on “the 8th February, being
Ash Wednesday, early in the morning, the Earl of Pembroke,
Lieutenant of the Queen’s army, with the horsemen and footmen
of the noblemen, gathered their armies together with
the Queen’s ordinance, and pitched their field by St. James
beyond Charing Cross, to abide the said traitor Wyatt and
his rebels. The Lord Mayor and the Lord Admiral set the
citizens in good array at Ludgate, Newgate, and from Cripplegate
to Bishopsgate, lest the rebels would draw to Finsbury
field, they to defend that side. Then Wyatt with his rebels
came to the park pale by St. James about 2 of the clock in
the afternoon, and Knevett one of his captains, with his
rebels went by Tothill through Westminster, and shot at the
Court gates. But Wyatt, perceiving the great army of the
Queen’s camp, and ordinance bent against him, suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
returned by the wall of the park at St. James, toward
Charing Cross, with the lightest of his soldiers, when the Earl
of Pembroke’s men cut off his train, and slew divers of the
rebels. But Wyatt himself, with divers other came in at
Temple Bar, and so through Fleetstreet to the Bell Savage,
crying ‘A Wyatt! a Wyatt! God save Queen Marie.’ But
when he saw that Ludgate was shut against him and the
ordinance bent, he fled back again, saying ‘I have kept
touch;’ and by Temple Bar was taken, with the Lord Cobham’s
son, and other of his captains and rebels, and brought
to the court gate, and from thence sent by water to the
Tower of London.”<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410"
class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>The next day, a solemn <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</span></i>
in thanksgiving for the
Queen’s victory was sung at St. Paul’s, and in every parish
church the bells were rung for joy.<a name="FNanchor_411_411"
id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>Mary, by her courage and great heart, had a second time
triumphed over the revolution. On the first occasion, she had
magnanimously thought to disarm, and win over the factious
by an almost universal pardon. Three victims only suffered
the just punishment of their crimes; two were held over as
hostages for the peaceable behaviour of the others; the rest
obtained a full and free forgiveness. Such clemency was a
complete innovation. If Mary cannot be said to have been
in advance, or even abreast of her time, in many ways, she
often rose above it, with the inevitable result that she was
misunderstood by some, and repaid by others with the grossest
ingratitude. The world has never been ripe for a clemency
such as she had extended to the insurgents after the first
rebellion. The elementary laws of rewards and punishments
were alone grasped by the people, accustomed to the frequent
spectacle of revolt followed by swift vengeance. The butchery
with which Henry VIII. had replied to the northern rising,
though an everlasting blot on his name, made him feared,
and his authority respected. Elizabeth’s ruthless punishment
of the Catholics of the north, after their abortive efforts to
bring back the Mass, resulted in peace for the remainder of
the reign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary’s wholesale forgiveness of the insurgents had been
interpreted as weakness, by a people who had not yet learned
that mercy “becomes the thronèd monarch better than his
crown”. Charles V. had insisted that it should be seasoned
with a larger measure of justice, but in this one point Mary
had disregarded his advice. Now her eyes were opened.
Had the rebels been treated with proper severity, there
would have been no second outbreak. Had Suffolk fallen
with Northumberland, as the consequence of his share in
Jane’s usurpation, his daughter would not have constituted a
danger to the State six months later. Even those who had
been implicated in the first plot were loud in maintaining that
there would now be no safety for the realm while Jane lived.<a name="FNanchor_412_412"
id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Both she and her husband had already been found guilty
by Parliament of high treason, and sentence of death was
passed in November 1553, although but for Suffolk’s action
they would undoubtedly both have been pardoned. Now,
however, recognising the disastrous consequences of her mildness,
Mary allowed herself to be guided by those who had
from the beginning advocated a policy of rigid justice; and
on the day after Wyatt’s arrest, she signed the warrant for
their execution.</p>

<p>Modern writers have not hesitated to accuse Mary of
cruelty and vindictiveness in causing the death of two persons
who, although usurpers, were but tools in masterful and
unscrupulous hands. This opinion does not appear to have
been shared by her contemporaries, who threw the blame
generally, not on the Queen, but on the Duke of Suffolk,
“who would have died more pitied for his weakness, if his
practices had not brought his daughter to her end”.<a name="FNanchor_413_413"
id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> They
argued, that to lay claim to a throne is a matter of so deep
an import, that even in deploring the necessity of executing
the Lady Jane and her husband, “their death being not easily
consented to, not even by the Queen herself,” they could not
help exculpating Mary, who adopted the measure for State
reasons and not from personal animosity.<a name="FNanchor_414_414"
id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
It is strange that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
with so great a personal reputation for clemency, in the
midst of a ferocious age, Mary should have come to be
regarded as an example of unparalleled cruelty, by all subsequent
generations. When we remember that during nearly
the whole of Elizabeth’s reign, the rack, the thumbscrew and
the terrible instrument known as “the Scavenger’s Daughter”
were never at rest, and that under Mary, contrary to the
custom of every court of justice in Europe, torture was
seldom applied to an accused person, the unfairness with
which she has been treated by historians is unmistakeably
apparent. Contemporaneous annalists, such as Holinshed
and Stow, are guiltless of the injustice; Foxe was the first
of Mary’s libellers, and Strype, who wrote at the end of the
seventeenth century, was not only biassed by Foxe, but was
embittered by the mass of calumny heaped upon her memory
by Anabaptists and Iconoclasts.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Winchester, preaching before her on the
11th February, “axed a boon of the Queen’s highness, that
like as she had before time extended her mercy particularly
and privately, so through her lenity and gentleness much
conspiracy and open rebellion was grown, according to the
proverb <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nimia familiaritas parit contemptum</span></i>;
which he brought
then in for the purpose that she would now be merciful to the
body of the commonwealth, and conservation thereof, which
could not be, unless the rotten and hurtful members thereof
were cut off and consumed”.<a name="FNanchor_415_415"
id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>The next day, Lady Jane Grey and Lord Guildford
Dudley were beheaded, he on Tower Hill, in presence of the
people, she within the Tower precincts, in consideration of her
royal descent. Mary had sent them permission to take leave
of each other, but Jane declined the favour, saying that they
would meet soon in heaven. Before laying her head on the
block, she acknowledged in a few words her guilt in having
consented to her father-in-law’s treason, although she had
not been one of the original conspirators.</p>

<p>Brett, with twenty other prisoners, was taken into Kent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
be executed. On leaving the Tower, he expressed himself
in these words: “I am worthy of no less punishment than I
do now go to suffer; for besides mine offence, I refused life
and grace three times when it was offered; but I trust God did
all for the best for me, that my soul might repent, and thereby
after this life attain to the more mercy and grace in his sight”.<a name="FNanchor_416_416"
id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>When the extreme penalty of the law had been suffered
by about sixty of the most prominent rebels, a general pardon
was extended to the mass of the Kentish insurgents. Four
hundred prisoners, with halters round their necks, rode into
the tilt yard at Whitehall, where the Queen, from a balcony
pardoned them, and ordered them to return home in peace.
Of those who still remained in the Tower, eight were pardoned
by her prerogative alone. Renard in his despatch of
the 27th March says with curious logic:—</p>

<p>“Sire, the Queen of England sent for me last Saturday,
and told me that persuaded by the Comptroller, Southwell,
Petre, and those who had examined the prisoners, she had
pardoned eight of them, having found no ground for suspecting
or accusing them of treason in the late rebellion. Among
others were the Marquess of Northampton, affirming that he
had returned to the old religion, Cobham and his eldest son,
Davet (Daniel) and four others whom she did not name, and
added that from time immemorial, it had been the custom
for the kings of England, on Good Friday to pardon some
prisoners. To this I answered that since it had pleased her
to dispense mercy, I could not and ought not to make any
objection, especially as she had done it by the advice of her
Councillors, but that she might have deferred the pardon till
it had been ascertained whether they were concerned in the
plot or no; for if they were, she had only thus increased the
number of her enemies by so many persons, setting them at
liberty to strengthen Elizabeth’s party.”<a name="FNanchor_417_417"
id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>He then goes on to say, that he had expressed doubts
regarding the coming of Philip, on account of the divisions
in the Council, objecting that he could not come in arms, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
yet that if anything befell him, it would be a most disastrous
and lamentable scandal. He had advised that the greatest
precautions should be taken for his safety, and the Queen had
replied with tears in her eyes, that she would rather never
have been born, than that any harm should happen to the
Prince, that the Council would do their utmost to receive
him worthily, that they were making great expense with that
object, that the Council should be reformed and reduced to
six members, a measure advised by Paget and Petre, and
that she, herself, would do all she could, to conciliate her subjects
in the matter. The people, she thought, were anxious
for the coming of his Highness, and she would exert every
effort to have the proceedings against Elizabeth and Courtenay
concluded before his arrival.<a name="FNanchor_418_418"
id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>
These proceedings had
arisen from Wyatt’s behaviour in the Tower, which was
singularly at variance with his dashing courage during the
revolt. Being questioned with regard to two intercepted
notes which he had addressed to Elizabeth, the one advising
her to remove to Donnington, the other informing her of
his triumphant arrival at Southwark, Wyatt admitted having
written to her more than once. Lord Russell, only son of the
Earl of Bedford, owned to having carried letters between him
and the Princess, and Croft confessed that he had urged her
to go to Donnington. All this, together with an intercepted
packet containing three letters from de Noailles to Henry II.,
and a copy of a letter from Elizabeth to the Queen, in answer
to one which Mary had sent her, added to Elizabeth’s refusal
to obey Mary’s summons, constituted strong presumptive
evidence that she was in league with the rebels.<a name="FNanchor_419_419"
id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Wyatt then
denounced Courtenay, who was at once arrested and brought
to the Tower, where the two were confronted with each other,
Wyatt accusing him of being as great a traitor as himself.
He further declared that the object of his rising was to place
Courtenay and Elizabeth on the throne. He subsequently
repeated the statement, and the second time added, that
Monsieur d’Oysel, who came to London in January, on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
way to Scotland to take up his functions as ambassador of
France at that court, had united his efforts to those of de Noailles,
and that they had conspired with Croft to prevent the Queen’s
marriage, and to compass her death. The King of France, to
enable them the more easily to carry on the chief enterprise,
having promised them men and money, was to attack Calais
and Guisnes, the moment they set foot in London. Besides
this, he was to organise a descent from Scotland, with which
object he had already sent some officers to that country, to
prepare the way, and he purposed despatching the Vidame de
Chartres, with artillery, ammunition, money and soldiers, to
begin the war in conjunction with the Scots.<a name="FNanchor_420_420"
id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>It was not until Wyatt had directly accused Elizabeth
of connivance with Henry II. that Mary was convinced of the
necessity of securing her person. More than a fortnight had
elapsed since the Princess had declared herself unable to
travel, and there was still no sign of her coming. The Queen
now repeated the summons, but not, as Foxe would have us
believe, with inconsiderate cruelty, and rough haste. Lord
William Howard, her uncle, Sir Edward Hastings and Sir
Thomas Cornwallis, who were sent to escort her, treated her
throughout with courtesy and consideration. The Queen’s
two physicians accompanied them, in order to decide whether
she were well enough to travel, and that she might accomplish
the journey with the greatest amount of comfort possible,
Mary sent her own litter.</p>

<p>“The Lord Admiral, Sir Edward Hastings and Sir Thomas
Cornwallays to the Queen.</p>

<p>“In humble wise. It may please your Highness to be
advertised, that yesterday immediately upon our arrival at
Ashridge, we required to have access unto my Lady Elizabeth’s
Grace, which obtained, we delivered unto her your
Highness’s letter, and I the Lord Admiral, declared the effect
of your Highness’s pleasure, according to the credence given
to us, being before advertised of her estate by your Highness’s
physicians, by whom we did perceive the estate of her body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
to be such, that without danger to her person, we might well
proceed to require her in your Majesty’s name (all excuses
set apart) to repair to your Highness, with all convenient
speed and diligence. Whereunto, we found her Grace very
willing and conformable, save only that she much feared her
weakness to be so great, that she should not be able to travel
and to endure the journey without peril of life, and therefore
desired some longer respite, until she had better recovered
her strength; but in conclusion, upon the persuasion as well
of us as of her own council and servants, whom we assure
your Highness, we have found very ready and forward to the
accomplishment of your Highness’s pleasure in this behalf,
she is resolved to remove her hence to-morrow, towards your
Highness, with such journeys as, by a paper herein enclosed,
your Highness shall perceive, further declaring to your Highness
that her Grace much desireth, if it might stand with
your Highness’s pleasure, that she might have a lodging, at
her coming to the Court, somewhat further from the water
than she had at her last being there; which your physicians,
considering the state of her body, thinketh very meet, who
have travailed very earnestly with her Grace, both before our
coming and after, in this matter. And after her first day’s
journey, one of us shall await upon your Highness to
declare more at large the whole estate of our proceedings
here.”<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421"

<p>The distance from Ashridge to Westminster is thirty-three
miles. It was decided to accomplish the journey in
five days, so that Elizabeth might have ample time to rest on
the road, but on her reaching Highgate, she was so ill from
some unknown cause, some declaring from poison, others
from apprehension, remorse and anger, others again imputing
a still more disgraceful reason for her malady, that a week
passed before the last stage could be undertaken. By some
indeed it was maintained that she was not ill at all, but that
the delay was occasioned by Lord William Howard’s desire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
to screen her, and by his hope that the Queen’s anger might
subside before she reached Westminster.<a name="FNanchor_422_422"
id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth was fully aware, not only of the danger of her
situation, on account of the depositions of the conspirators
in the Tower, but also of the reports circulated against her
honour, and her courage rose as her need became desperate.
She had long been an adept in the art of self-defence, and it
was on occasions such as this, that her talents shone most
brightly. On the 22nd February, between four and five
o’clock in the afternoon, escorted by 200 gentlemen of the
Queen’s court, she descended the steep hill that lies to the
north-west of London, and proceeded to Westminster. The
people flocked in immense crowds to meet her, lining both
sides of the road, and testifying, now by a mournful silence,
now by sighs and groans, their sympathy with her condition.</p>

<p>Renard thus describes the scene:—</p>

<p>“The lady Elizabeth arrived here yesterday, clad completely
in white, surrounded by a great assemblage of the
servants of the Queen, besides her own people. She caused
her litter to be uncovered, that she might show herself to
the people. Her countenance was pale, her look proud, lofty
and superbly disdainful; an expression which she assumed
to disguise the mortification she felt. The Queen declined
seeing her, and caused her to be accommodated in a quarter
of her palace, from which neither she nor her servants could
go out, without passing through the guards. Of her suite,
only two gentlemen, six ladies and four servants are permitted
to wait on her; the rest of her train being lodged in
the city of London. The Queen is advised to send her to
the Tower, since she is accused by Wyatt, named in the
letters of the French ambassador, suspected by her own
councillors, and it is certain that the enterprise was undertaken
in her favour. And assuredly, Sire, if now that the
occasion offers, they do not punish her and Courtenay, the
Queen will never be secure; for I have many misgivings that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
if, when she sets out for the parliament, they leave Elizabeth
in the Tower, some treasonable means will be found to deliver
either Courtenay or her, or both, so that the last error
will be worse than the first.”<a name="FNanchor_423_423"
id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>Parliament had been summoned to meet at Oxford, on the
2nd April, and after the session Mary thought of establishing
herself at York, in the midst of a Catholic population, a convenient
port being in the vicinity. But the Londoners viewed
her proposed withdrawal from their city with alarm. The
removal of the seat of government from Westminster would
deprive them of that consideration which they had always
enjoyed; the absence of the court would divest them effectually
of their prestige, and the transference of commerce from
the Thames to the Tees and the Humber would involve them
in financial ruin. This triple loss was apparently to be the
only result to them of the blood that had been shed in the
cause of independence, and for which they had been largely
responsible. The anticipation of it did more to awaken their
loyalty, than the spectacle they had lately witnessed of Mary’s
queenly courage in the midst of dangers that had paralysed
them with fear, or her noble words to them on the eve of
the contest at the Guildhall. Overshadowed by the prospect
of substantial material losses, they forgot the bugbears with
which the French ambassador had threatened them, if the
Spaniards should come—forgot that they were to be reduced
to slavery, to have the Inquisition forced upon them, and to
suffer dishonour and untold horrors, the common heritage of
a subjugated race. They petitioned the Queen humbly to
remain in their midst, promising to render her all the help in
their power, and to welcome whatever marriage she desired.<a name="FNanchor_424_424"
id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of this petition, Parliament met at Westminster,
and the Queen abandoned her intention of removing
the court to the north. The Royal Marriage Bill was discussed,
and passed unanimously in both Houses, after which
Mary dissolved Parliament in person, delivering an address
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
that was frequently interrupted by cheers and acclamation.
Both Lords and Commons assured her at its close, that the
Prince of Spain would be welcomed on his arrival by a dutiful
and affectionate people.<a name="FNanchor_425_425"
id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>The preliminary formalities between the contracting parties,
interrupted by the rebellion, had been resumed. Count
Egmont had returned to England, bringing with him the
ratification of the marriage treaty, and a letter of instructions
from Charles. He was to represent to Mary, that as God had
been pleased once more to give her the victory over her
enemies, and to deliver them into her hands, she should, as
they had before so largely abused the clemency with which
she had treated them, and in case they had not yet been
brought to execution, not delay to do so, but that their
chastisement should be prompt, and that she should rid
herself of those whose will was so evil towards her, that she
might strike terror into the hearts of others. Those who were
to be pardoned should be pardoned also promptly, that their
fears being removed, they might the sooner lose the desire
to attempt anything further against her. Courtenay and
Elizabeth should be secured,<a name="FNanchor_426_426"
id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
and the Queen should reflect
that in the matter of so manifest a conspiracy against her
person, the smallest evidence of guilt might be taken into
account, and the persons suspected should be put into a place
where they would have no longer the opportunity of doing
harm. He added that if the Privy Council could not be
induced to proceed against Courtenay, he would be better out
of the kingdom than in it, for if the people no longer saw him
they would soon forget him. He ought to be either shut up
in the Tower or got rid of.</p>

<p>With regard to the mischievous practices of the French
ambassador, Egmont was to represent to the Queen, that it
would be well, either to send him back to France at once,
or to imprison him till he should be recalled, to prevent his
doing further harm, giving the French King to understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
in either case, what grave cause she had to proceed severely,
he having acted in such a manner as to lose altogether his
privileges as ambassador. Egmont was also to advise Mary
to obtain the recall of the Venetian ambassador, Sorranzo.
<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427"
class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>With unparalleled effrontery, both the French and Venetian
ambassadors presented themselves at court, and congratulated
Mary on her victory. The Council thought it advisable that
the Queen should conceal her indignation for a time, and
she, therefore, received them courteously. De Noailles was,
however, closely watched, a measure which he was not slow
to perceive, and complain of, whereupon Mary in an audience
of the 1st March, reproached him vehemently with having
stirred up the late rebellion, and with continuing the same
line of conduct with respect to some of Wyatt’s accomplices
who had fled into France, meaning probably the Carews
and their friends.</p>

<p>De Noailles, of course, denied all that he dared, promised
to give entire satisfaction as to the rest, and proceeded
forthwith to concoct schemes, by which his promises would
be entirely stultified. All that he relates henceforth touching
the Queen’s marriage, the punishment of the rebels, and the
restoration of the Catholic worship, is coloured by personal
animosity, and must be received with caution, his new resentment
and annoyance rendering his testimony less trustworthy
than before.</p>

<p>On the day after Elizabeth’s arrival at Westminster, the
Duke of Suffolk was beheaded on Tower Hill. He confessed
his guilt, and expressed a hope that the Queen would forgive
him.</p>

<p>“My Lord, her grace hath already forgiven and prayeth
for you,” said Dr. Weston, his confessor. “Then,” continued
the Duke, “I beseech you all good people, to let me be an
example to you all for obedience to the Queen and the
magistrates, for the contrary thereof hath brought me to this
end.”<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428"
class="fnanchor">[428]</a> He called them to witness that he died “a faithful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
and true Christian, believing to be saved by none other but
only by Almighty God through the Passion of his Son Jesus
Christ”. His brother Thomas, who was believed to have incited
him to rebellion, was also executed, but the Lord John
Grey, who was taken with him, was pardoned by the Queen.</p>

<p>At his trial, Wyatt pleaded guilty, and made no defence.
He referred his interrogators to his written declaration, and
refused to enter into further details. He was condemned
to death, but his execution was deferred for a month, in
the hope of his giving further information as to the other
implicated persons. His accusation of Elizabeth made it
necessary that she should be examined, but the result obtained
might have been a foregone conclusion. When the
Chancellor, with nine members of the Council, went to
Westminster, and charged her with complicity in the plot,
she replied boldly that she knew nothing of it whatever.
Gardiner entreated her for her own sake to throw herself
on the Queen’s mercy, and to crave her pardon. But she
answered proudly that this would be to confess a crime,
and that forgiveness was only extended to the guilty. First,
her guilt must be proved, in which case she would follow
the Chancellor’s advice.<a name="FNanchor_429_429"
id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429"
class="fnanchor">[429]</a> They were obliged to leave without
having gained anything by their visit. The councillors were
more than ever divided. Those among them who secretly
favoured Elizabeth maintained that the legal proof against
her was insufficient to justify her being sent to the Tower;
the Spanish party were for giving her short shrift. Others
again thought that she ought to be closely guarded, but
not imprisoned. Mary availed herself of this loophole, and
caused each lord of the Council in succession to be asked
to undertake the custody of the Princess in his own house.
Not one was willing to accept the dangerous office, and when
all had refused it, a warrant was made out for her committal
to the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430"
class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Thoroughly alarmed, and fully expecting to suffer the
same fate as her unfortunate mother, Elizabeth denied with
oaths and curses that she had ever had any letter from
Wyatt, that she had ever written to the French King, or
consented to anything that might endanger the Queen’s life.
Haughtily she begged those who brought her the news to
remember who she was. An hour later, the Earl of Sussex
and two other members of the Council dismissed her suite,
leaving her only one gentleman, three ladies and two servants.
Guards were placed in her antechamber, and in the garden
under her windows. The next morning, Saturday, 17th March,
the Earl of Sussex and the Marquis of Winchester announced
that her barge was in attendance to convey her to the Tower.
Her scornful mood having changed to one of deep depression,
she entreated to be allowed to wait for the next tide. Lord
Winchester answered her tritely, that time and tide waited
for no man, whereupon she begged that they would at least
permit her to write a few lines to the Queen. Winchester
again refused, but the Earl of Sussex, more friendly, gave
her leave, and swore that he himself would deliver her letter,
and bring her back the answer. She was so long in writing
it, that the tide no longer served, and Elizabeth scored her
usual point of delay. She obtained, indeed, twenty-four
hours respite, for her guards would not risk the midnight
tide, for fear of a rescue under cover of the darkness. Mary,
extremely displeased, exclaimed with some bitterness that
in her father’s time they would not have dared to take
upon themselves such disobedience, and vouchsafed no answer
to Elizabeth’s letter.</p>

<p>The next day being Palm Sunday, at nine o’clock the
warrant was executed, and the Princess conducted through
the guards to her barge, which was moored at the water
entrance to the palace. Foxe says,<a name="FNanchor_431_431"
id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> “Being come forth into
the garden, she did cast her eyes towards the window, thinking
to have seen the Queen, which she could not: whereat
she said, she marvelled much what the nobility of the realm
meant, which in that sort would suffer her to be led into
captivity, the Lord knew whither, for she did not,” a remark
which, perhaps, savoured of treason more than anything else
she allowed to escape her.</p>

<p>According to the chronicler already often quoted:—</p>

<p>“The 18th March, being 1553 [1554], the lady Elizabeth’s
grace, the queen’s sister, was conveyed to the Tower, from
the court at Westminster, about ten of the clock in the forenoon,
by water; accompanying her the Marquis of Northampton
[probably a mistake for Winchester] and the Earl of Sussex.
There was at the Tower to receive her, the lord Chamberlain.
She was taken in at the drawbridge. It is said when she
came in, she said to the warders and soldiers, looking up to
heaven, ‘Oh Lord, I never thought to have come in here as
prisoner; and I pray you all, good friends and fellows, bear
me witness, that I come in no traitor, but as true a woman to
the Queen’s Majesty as any is now living; and thereon will I
take my death’. And so, going a little further, she said to
my lord Chamberlain, ‘What, are all these harnessed men
here for me?’ And he said, ‘No, Madam’. ‘Yes,’ she said,
‘I know it is so; it needed not for me, being alas! but a weak
woman.’ It is said that when she was in, the lord Treasurer
and the lord Chamberlain began to lock the doors very
straitly; then the Earl of Sussex with weeping eyes said,
‘What will ye do, my lords? What mean ye therein? She
was a king’s daughter, and is the queen’s sister; and ye have
no sufficient commission so to do; therefore go no further
than your commission, which I know what it is.’”<a name="FNanchor_432_432"
id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth’s trial began five days after her committal.
Gardiner, accompanied by nine members of the Privy Council,
proceeded to an interrogatory, concerning what had passed
between the Princess and Sir James Croft, as to her proposed
removal from Ashridge to Donnington. She feigned at first
not to know that she had such a house as Donnington, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
after a moment’s reflection, said that she did remember having
such a place, but that she had never been inside it. Confronted
with Croft, she was asked what she had to say of him, and she
replied, that she had no more to do with him than with any of
the other prisoners in the Tower, declaring with great dignity
that if they had done ill, and had offended the Queen’s Majesty,
it was their business to answer for it; and she begged that
she might not be associated with criminals of that sort.</p>

<p>“Concerning my going to Donnington Castle,” she continued,
“I do remember that Master Hoby and mine officers,
and you, Sir James Croft, had such talk. But what is that to
the purpose, my lords, but that I may go to my houses at all
times?”<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433"
class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>Nothing further could be obtained from her; and the Emperor
demanded in vain that she should be executed. Mary,
although personally convinced of her guilt, as were so many
others, would not have her condemned on the evidence of the
intercepted letters, because they were written in cypher, which
easily lent itself to forgery.<a name="FNanchor_434_434"
id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434"
class="fnanchor">[434]</a> In her first Parliament, she had
restored the ancient constitutional law of England, by which
overt or spoken acts of treason must be proved, before any
English person could be convicted as a traitor; and from this
position the Queen would not move. She told Renard, that
she herself, and her Council, were labouring to discover the
truth, but that the law must be maintained.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Elizabeth’s enemies neither slumbered nor
slept, and if we may trust the author<a name="FNanchor_435_435"
id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
of a book called <i>England’s
Elizabeth</i>, published in 1631, a warrant was actually
handed in at the Tower, for her execution, under the Queen’s
seal, but without her signature. The Lieutenant, Sir John
Bridges, in the absence of the Constable, suspecting foul play,
hastened with it to the Queen, who denied all knowledge
of the warrant, and expressed great indignation against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Chancellor, who was probably responsible. According to this
author, the Queen summoned Gardiner, and several others to
her presence, and “blamed them for their inhuman usage of
her sister, and took measures for her greater security”. But
as the story is unsupported by any corroboration, it seems
likely that it was, in its circumstantial points, an invention.
Gardiner was known to protect Elizabeth against the clamour
of the imperial ambassador for her execution, and indeed he
befriended her all through. Nevertheless, there was a very
general impression, that her life would have been in danger
but for Mary’s determination that the law should not be
infringed. It was for Elizabeth’s greater safety that Mary
appointed Sir Henry Bedingfeld to be her custodian in the
Tower, giving her at the same time leave to walk in the
Queen’s lodging, provided that she did not look out through
any of the windows, there being so many prisoners in the
Tower at that time. A little later, leave was given to her to
take the air in the garden, the doors and gates being shut.
Here, the child of one of the warders was allowed to come and
talk to her sometimes, until it was suspected that Courtenay
contrived to communicate with her, by means of a basket of
flowers and figs, whereupon the indulgence was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Mary’s solemn betrothal to Philip had taken place on the
return of Count Egmont from Brussels, with the Emperor’s
ratification of the marriage treaty. The members of the Privy
Council having waited on the Queen at Whitehall, Mary proceeded
to her oratory, when Egmont was introduced by the
Lord Admiral, and the Earl of Pembroke. She knelt down
before the altar, and called God to witness the truth of the
words she was about to speak. Then rising, and turning towards
the assistants (most of whom were in favour of the
marriage, and therefore not to be cajoled by her words into
toleration of it), she declared that she had not resolved to
marry through dislike of celibacy, nor had she chosen the
Prince of Spain through any respect of kindred, her chief
object being the furtherance of the honour and tranquillity of
the realm. She had, she said, pledged her faith to her people
on her coronation day, and it was her steadfast resolve to redeem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
that pledge. She would never permit affection for her
husband to seduce her from the performance of this, the first
and most sacred of her duties. As Mary ceased speaking,
Egmont advanced, and placed on her finger a costly ring, sent
by the Emperor on behalf of his son.<a name="FNanchor_436_436"
id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>Renard, in the meanwhile, took great credit to himself for
the promptness with which the rebellion had been quelled.
It was no doubt partly due to his advice to the Queen, to
remain at her post, at a critical moment, when all other counsellors
were entreating her to fly, that the rebels had been put
to rout. With great self-complacency, he informed the Emperor,
that all the members of the Queen’s Privy Council had
become very intimate with him, and admitted that “the firmness
of the said Lady had alone gained the victory, for in
leaving London, she would have involved the kingdom in
danger and ruin”. He remarked however, on the admirable
conduct of the English nobility, at the battle of London, and
dealt a passing blow at Courtenay, and the young Earl of
Worcester, whose cowardice had prompted them to remain
always in the rear, without once charging the enemy, but
spreading the alarm that the rebels had the advantage, crying
out that all was lost, the wish being father to the thought.<a name="FNanchor_437_437"
id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>But when he went on to express satisfaction at seeing
peace re-established, Wyatt discredited by the people, a large
number of the nobility well-disposed towards the marriage,
and the popular prejudice against it less acute, his credulity
clearly overstepped the boundary of facts. The people’s prejudice,
thanks to the agitators, was certainly not less acute,
the vexed question of the marriage being still inextricably
involved in that of religion. To express their hatred of
both, the London rabble hung a cat on the gallows in Cheapside
“clothed like a priest, and that same day, held it up before
the preacher at Paul’s Cross”.<a name="FNanchor_438_438"
id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
During a procession in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Smithfield, a man tore the consecrated Host out of the priest’s
hand, and drew a dagger. He was seized and taken to Newgate.<a name="FNanchor_439_439"
id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
A musket was discharged at a priest during a sermon,
when he was surrounded by nearly four thousand people.</p>

<p>No wonder that Philip delayed his coming! If he escaped
the arrow flying by day, how could he guard himself against
the hidden enemy that might be lurking in the dish and the
cup? Even Renard at last ceased to cry “peace” when all
the time there was no security. “It is well-nigh impossible
to foresee what the English may do,” he wrote to the Emperor,
and advised him to send over a competent steward, “against
the arrival of his Highness,” a man of good appearance, adroitness
and experience, to superintend the preparing of his food,
and to make acquaintance with the officials, and with the
customs of the country; otherwise dire confusion and danger
would ensue. The want of understanding between Renard
and the Queen’s English advisers increased the difficulties at
every step. Mary and her Council were for treating the peace
disturbers as heretics. The enormities which they practised
were all directed against religion, and it seemed just that the
punishment should be adapted to the offence. But Renard
knew full well that this mode of procedure would but increase
the public irritation against Spain, which was at the bottom of
the disturbances, and still further complicate the political situation.
He never ceased admonishing the Queen to have these
outrages dealt with as seditious, and on the 22nd March
wrote:—</p>

<p>“Things are in such disorder, that we know not who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
well-disposed or ill-disposed, constant or inconstant, loyal or
traitorous. One thing is certain, that the Chancellor has been
extremely remiss in proceeding against the criminals, and
most ardent and hot-headed in the affairs of religion, being
so hated in this kingdom, that I have doubts whether the
detestation against him will not recoil on the Queen. Assuredly,
Sire, I have never ceased to admonish her as to the
necessity of a prompt punishment of the prisoners. I have
given her Thucydides translated into French, so that she may
understand what advice he gives, and what kind of punishment
ought to be inflicted on rebels.”<a name="FNanchor_440_440"
id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>Renard’s natural dislike of Gardiner, and the divergence
of their aims, probably spoke here more eloquently than the
fact justified. Other evidence will show that Gardiner was
not hated, even by the reformers, with the exception of Foxe.</p>

<p>But there was ample ground for Renard’s fear lest Mary’s
popularity should decline, and not least among the reasons
for such a decline was the fact, that she had abrogated the law
framed by her father, by which libels on the sovereign were
punishable by death. The country was inundated, at this
time, with foul and scurrilous sermons and pamphlets, the perpetrators
screening themselves behind the Queen’s strictly
constitutional mode of government, knowing that the utmost
penalty for language that would be an insult to the meanest
woman in the land, and which they freely indulged in to
vilify their Queen, would but cause them a brief and slight
inconvenience. Thus we hear of two men in the pillory in
Cheapside “for horrible lies and seditious words against the
Queen’s Majesty and her Council,”<a name="FNanchor_441_441"
id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>
and this kind of punishment
became now of frequent occurrence, although most of
the slanders were anonymous, and could never be traced to
their authors.</p>

<p>As to Renard’s constant refrain that “the prisoners,”
meaning of course Elizabeth and Courtenay, should be
promptly punished, it must be admitted that he spoke with
full knowledge of the danger they represented. Their names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
were ever on the lips of the rebels, and on the 7th April
a letter was found dropped in the street, in favour of the
Princess, “as seditious as could possibly be conceived”.
Even Gardiner confessed that there was no hope of peace
or tranquillity for the realm while she was in it, and he
advised that she should be sent abroad, and placed under the
care of the Queen of Hungary, the Emperor’s sister.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Wyatt was brought to the scaffold on the
12th April,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442"
class="fnanchor">[442]</a> and so contradictory are the statements as to his
conduct and words at the moment of death, concerning the
guilt of the accused pair, that absolutely nothing can be
deduced from them. According to the sheriffs who were
present at his last interview with Courtenay, Wyatt asked
his pardon for accusing him. According to Lord Chandos,
who was also present, he urged Courtenay to confess his
crime. On the scaffold he is said to have uttered these words:
“Where it is noised abroad, that I should accuse the Lady
Elizabeth and the Lord Courtenay, it is not so, good people;
for I assure you, neither they nor any other now yonder in
hold, was privy of my rising before I began, as I have declared
no less to the Queen’s Council, and that is most true”. Upon
this, however, Weston said: “Mark this, my masters, that
that which he hath shown to the Council of them in writing
is true,” and Wyatt by his silence implied that he consented
to what Weston had said.<a name="FNanchor_443_443"
id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>
But as no fresh evidence was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
forthcoming, and as the case against Elizabeth had not been
formally proved, she was released from the Tower on the 18th
May, exactly two months after her committal. As she left,
three volleys of artillery were discharged from the Steelyard
in sign of rejoicing and congratulation.[3] A few days later
Courtenay was also released, and sent to Fotheringhay.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Bedingfeld had already for some time had the
charge of the Princess, and it was to his care, and that of
the Lord Williams of Thame, that she was confided, on her
removal to Woodstock. Foxe’s account of the supposed
insults offered to her by Sir Henry Bedingfeld, totally unsupported
by any other evidence, falls into the region of
romance, the source of much that has been written about
Elizabeth at this period. When she came to the throne
Bedingfeld frequently appeared at court and was on the
best terms with her, she playfully styling him her jailer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Elizabeth was very closely kept and watched
during the months of her captivity at Woodstock, allowed to
see none but those appointed to be near her, and deprived
of materials for writing, even to Mary, unless with direct
permission. It would, however, have been very unlike what
we know of her astuteness, if she had not contrived means
of communication with her friends. It was shortly before
leaving Woodstock, that she wrote with a diamond on a pane
of glass, the famous three lines, two of which sum up the
whole case for and against her:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">Much suspected by me,</div>
    <div class="verse">Nothing proved can be,</div>
    <div class="verse">Quoth Elizabeth, prisoner.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>At last Philip showed signs of leaving Spain. On the
19th June, arrived his precursor, the Marquis de las Naves,
bringing presents for the bride. These were: “A great table
diamond mounted as a rose, in a superb gold setting, and
valued at 50,000 ducats; a necklace of eighteen brilliants,
worth 32,000 ducats; a great diamond, with a fine pearl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
pendant from it, worth 25,000 ducats, and other jewels, pearls,
diamonds, emeralds and rubies of inestimable value, for the
Queen and her ladies”.</p>

<p>Philip left Valladolid on the 4th May, and his progress
through the north-western provinces of Spain was a splendid
pageant, for the crowds of spectators that flocked to meet
him, with demonstrations of intense and passionate devotion.
He remained several days at Compostella to pay homage to
the patron saint of Spain. Here, he signed his marriage
contract, brought from England by the Earl of Bedford, and
then proceeded to Corunna, where a flotilla of more than a
hundred sail was anchored in the bay.</p>

<p>Accompanied by 4,000 picked troops, destined for the
Netherlands, he embarked with a numerous suite, including
the Flemish Counts, Egmont and Horn, the Dukes of Alva
and Medina Cœli, the Prince of Eboli, the Count, afterwards
Duke, of Feria, and all the flower of the Spanish nobility,
together with their wives, their vassals, musicians, and even
jesters, and a number of useless servants, in order to swell his
train, add to the splendour of his cortège, and impart a notion
of his magnificence.</p>

<p>The imperial ambassador in London had advised him to
come with as little state as possible, “in order not to excite
the jealousy of the English,” but perhaps the philosophy of
the younger man was deeper than that of the statesman.
The good-will of a people may be won by frank simplicity;
their ill-will is rarely conquered but by a display of power
and circumstance, which commands their respect.</p>

<p>After an agreeable sail of a few days, the Spanish fleet
encountered that of England, commanded by Lord William
Howard, who was lying in wait for the Prince, in order
to conduct him into British waters. The Admiral at once
offended the Spaniards, by speaking of their ships as mussel-shells;
and it was reported, that on nearing the Spanish
fleet, he ordered a salvo of cannon to be fired, to oblige the
Spaniards to lower their flag in returning the salute, thereby
acknowledging the supremacy of the English. If these reports
reached Philip’s ears, they would be eloquent to him of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
spirit stirring beneath the apparent cordiality of his welcome.
But there was nothing in the grave courtesy of his manner,
and in the high breeding which gave dignity to his slight and
otherwise almost insignificant figure, to indicate that he was
not solemnly satisfied with all that he heard and saw.</p>

<p>On the 19th July, the united fleets anchored in Southampton
water. Immediately, a number of small craft put out,
and foremost among them the Queen’s own yacht, superbly
decorated, and manned with officers wearing the royal livery
of green and white, to bring the Prince to land.<a name="FNanchor_444_444"

which he has interpolated words into Renard’s despatch of the 17th December
1553, to the effect that the Queen was bent on Elizabeth’s death (vol. vi., p. 129).

So highly was this treaty esteemed by the statesmen of the following
reign, that in the negotiations for a marriage between Elizabeth and the Duke
of Anjou, the marriage articles of Philip and Mary were repeatedly quoted in
a memorial endorsed by Lord Burghley, and still preserved at Hatfield, in
answer to objections brought forward against the Queen’s marriage with a
foreign prince. “It behoves her Majesty” said Elizabeth’s ministers, “to have
the like proceedings herein as was for Queen Mary’s marriage.” The country
should not be governed by a foreigner, but by the Queen herself and her
Council, by the laws of the realm “as it was in the time of King Philip and
Queen Mary” (Historical MSS. Commission, Hatfield MSS., vol. ii., pp. 241,
243, 288, 291-93, 544, 556).</p></div>

Lingard and Miss Strickland have supposed with Griffet, that Mary herself
questioned the Lords of the Privy Council on this subject. But Wiesener
points out (<i>La Jeunesse d’Elisabeth</i>, p. 224 note) that in the document on
which P. Griffet supports the statement, namely, Renard’s letter of the 22nd
March, no mention is made of the Queen’s presence at that sitting; and he
agrees with Froude that the question was probably put by the Chancellor.</p></div>

<i>Grey Friars’ Chronicle</i>, p. 88. “A dead cat having a cloth like a vestment
of the priest at Mass with a cross on it afore, and another behind put on
it; the crown of the cat shorn, a piece of paper like a singing-cake put between
the forefeet of the said cat, bound together, which cat was hanged on the post
of the gallows in Cheap, beyond the Cross, in the parish of St. Matthew, and a
bottle hanged by it; which cat was taken down at 6 of the clock in the morning,
and carried to the Bishop of London, and he caused it to be showed openly in
the sermon time at Paul’s Cross, in the sight of all the audience there present.
The Lord Mayor with his brethren, the aldermen of the city of London, caused
a proclamation to be made that afternoon, that whosoever could utter, or show
the author of the said fact, should have £6 13s. 4d. for his pains, and a better
reward with hearty thanks. But at that time after much enquiry and search
made, it could not be known, but divers persons were had to prison for suspicions
of it” (Wriothesley, <i>Chronicle</i>, vol. ii., p. 114).</p></div>

“The xii day of April was Sir Thomas Wyatt set upon the gallows on
Hay Hill, beside Hyde Park, where did hang three men in chains, where the
Queen’s men and Wyatt’s men did skirmish, where he and his captains were
overcome, thank be to God” (Machyn, <i>Diary</i>, p. 60). According to Wriothesley,
Wyatt was beheaded on Tower Hill “at 6 o’clock in the forenoon,
and his body after quartered on the scaffold” (<i>Chronicle</i>, vol. ii., p. 115).
Wriothesley gives the date of his execution as the 11th April. It is probable
that one of his quarters was set on the gallows on Hay Hill.</p></div>

Lingard remarks, that as for Elizabeth and Courtenay not being “privy”
to Wyatt’s rising, “it may certainly be true, for he rose unexpectedly six weeks
before the time originally fixed upon” (<i>History of England</i>, vol. v., p. 434 note).
Holinshed says that Wyatt protested against being pressed to say anything
more in his wretched condition; that he declared it went against him to accuse
any one by name, but that having confessed everything to her Grace, he begged
that he might be tormented with no more questions (<i>Chronicle</i>, 1103, 1104, 1111).</p></div>

<p class="ac noindent">PHILIP AND MARY.</p>

<p class="ac noindent"><i>July</i> 1554-<i>August</i> 1555.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Philip</span> had married as his first wife the daughter of John III.,
King of Portugal, who had died in 1552, having given birth to
a son, the unfortunate and notorious Don Carlos. Charles V.
then entered into negotiations for a union between his son
and the King of Portugal’s sister, whose dowry amounted to
more than a million gold ducats. But unwilling that so large
a sum should pass out of the country, King John was in no
hurry to bring matters to a conclusion, and while he haggled
over the terms of the marriage treaty, the death of Edward VI.
opened out a new political vista. The Emperor seeing the
possibility of a geographical combination, that would materially
help him to overthrow his old enemy France, wrote to
Philip, telling him to suspend the negotiations with Portugal
if they were not already concluded. A matrimonial alliance
with England would, he conceived, equal in importance that
of the Dauphin with the young Scottish Queen, Mary Stuart.
Philip, perfectly docile, agreed to his father’s scheme,<a name="FNanchor_445_445"
id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> and
thus the fuse was set to the train laid by de Noailles, resulting
in the conflagration described in the last chapter. But
Mary’s firmness and courage, and the enthusiasm with which
she had inspired her army, quickly extinguished the flames of
revolution, and notwithstanding the dissensions in her Council,
a far too numerous and unwieldy body, her government was
stronger than before Wyatt’s rebellion. De Noailles had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
gained nothing by his treachery, except the questionable
glory of having successfully worked upon the worst passions
of the rabble. Painfully conscious that he had little cause for
self-congratulation, and anxious to know how far the Queen
was informed of his secret practices, and what were her feelings
towards France, he demanded an audience in the middle
of June, when the court was on the eve of removing to Windsor.
Mary received him coldly, and when he complained, that
although his master desired to continue the peace, her ministers
appeared to be otherwise disposed, she told him roundly that
neither the King of France nor his advisers had displayed
much inclination towards peace in the past, and that not for
all the kingdoms in the world would her conscience have permitted
her to play such a part as he, de Noailles, had played.
This outspokenness on the part of the Queen so disconcerted
the ambassador, that he begged Henry to send him a safe-conduct
and his recall.<a name="FNanchor_446_446"
id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
Nevertheless, he was obliged to
remain where he was, and he continued to be the most mischievous
person in England. In giving an account of this
audience to his master, de Noailles expressed the opinion
that Philip had “something in hand against France”. But
in this he was mistaken. Philip had no independent policy
apart from the Emperor’s. Whatever his defects of mind and
character, he was a perfect son, and while his father lived,
Philip lived but to obey his behests. The chief of these now
was, that he should marry Mary, and seek to conciliate the
English.</p>

<p>Michiel, the Venetian ambassador, who had seen the
Prince in Italy, describes him as the image of the Emperor,
even to his hanging under-lip, the distinguishing feature of
the Hapsburgs. He was not quite so tall (and Charles V.
was but of medium height), but well-proportioned and agile,
as had often been proved in tournaments, on foot and on
horseback, armed and unarmed.<a name="FNanchor_447_447"
id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
He is elsewhere described
as short but slender, with a fine broad brow, large blue eyes,
dense, fair eyebrows, very close together, a nose well formed, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
large mouth, with a thick and pendent under-lip, which rather
spoiled his appearance. His skin was white, and his hair
flaxen, like that of a Fleming, but here the resemblance to
his northern ancestors ceased, his tastes and manners being
essentially Spanish. Even in his early manhood, he was
inclined to be thoughtful and laborious. It was observed
that he listened attentively to all that was said to him, but
spoke little, and that little cautiously, with his eyes bent on
the ground. If he raised them, it was to allow them to
wander hither and thither. His answers were prompt, short
and to the purpose, but he was careful never to compromise
himself in any way.<a name="FNanchor_448_448"
id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>
At the end of his first visit to Flanders,
the Emperor, who idolised him, took him to task for his cold
and haughty bearing. Philip learned the lesson so well, that
on his second visit, it was remarked that his manner was
more affable, recalling that of his father, and retaining no
trace of the disdain which had before caused him to be so
much disliked in the Low Countries. He differed from
the Emperor, inasmuch as Charles delighted in warfare, and
military exercises, whereas Philip cared nothing for them, and
understood them but little. He was fond of study, and especially
of the study of history; he knew the exact position
of every important place on the map, was a good mathematician,
and had some notions of sculpture and of painting,
which arts he sometimes practised. His own language he
spoke with elegance, knew Latin well enough for a prince,
understood and wrote Italian, and some French, and possessed
an excellent memory. He was slow in his movements,
both naturally and from his having schooled himself
in extreme deliberation, a characteristic often illustrated by
remarks which he was in the habit of writing on the margin of
official documents, and in letters to his friends and servants.
One such expression, written to an Italian diplomat, “<i>bisogna
caminare coi piedi di piombo</i>,” is an epitome of his manner of
conducting business. He was careful to surround even the
smallest affair with an atmosphere of dignity, a custom that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
may partly account for his dilatoriness. As he was habitually
grave and distant, his courtesy was the more appreciated
when he forced himself to unbend. In his opinion, no nation
on earth equalled the Spanish nation, and he admitted none
but Spaniards into his counsels and intimacy. His piety
was considered remarkable, because he heard Mass daily, and
approached the sacraments at least four times a year. Capable
as he was of prolonged and careful attention to the minutest
details of business, he was naturally fond of repose and
solitude, especially in summer, when he made a point of
seldom granting audiences on affairs of state. So great was
his power of self-control, that even in taking vengeance, he
would sometimes wait for years for an opportune moment,
when he would strike without passion and without pity.<a name="FNanchor_449_449"
id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
His morals were neither better nor worse than those of the
majority of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Such was Philip in his twenty-seventh year, at the time of
his second marriage.</p>

<p>Sorranzo’s description of Mary, at the age of thirty-eight,
is important, as coming from the pen of a none too friendly
critic. In the Venetian ambassador’s description of England
in 1554 occurs the following paragraph:—</p>

<p>“The most serene Madam Mary is entitled Queen of
England and of France, and Defendress of the Faith. She
was born on the 18 February 1515 [1516], so she yesterday
completed her thirty-eighth year, and six months. She is of
low stature with a red and white complexion, and very thin.
Her eyes are white [light?] and large, and her hair reddish;
her face is round, with a nose rather low and wide, and were
not her age on the decline, she might be called handsome rather
than the contrary. She is not of a strong constitution, and of
late she suffers from headache, and serious affection of the heart,
so that she is often obliged to take medicine, and also to be
blooded. She is of very spare diet, and never eats till one or
two p.m., although she rises at daybreak, when after saying
her prayers, and hearing Mass in private, she transacts business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
incessantly until after midnight, when she retires to rest; for
she chooses to give audience not only to all the members
of her Privy Council, and to hear from them every detail
of public business, but also to all other persons who ask it
of her. Her Majesty’s countenance indicates great benignity
and clemency, which are not belied by her conduct, for although
she has had many enemies, and though so many of
them were by law condemned to death, yet had the executions
depended solely on her Majesty’s will, not one of them perhaps
would have been enforced; but deferring to her Council
in everything, she in this matter likewise complied with the
wishes of others, rather than with her own. She is endowed
with excellent ability, and more than moderately read in
Latin literature, especially with regard to Holy Writ; and
besides her native tongue, she speaks Latin, French and
Spanish, and understands Italian perfectly, but does not
speak it. She is also very generous, but not to the extent
of letting it appear that she rests her chief claim to commendation
on this quality. She is so confirmed in the
Catholic religion, that although the King her brother, and his
Council, prohibited her from having the Mass celebrated
according to the Roman Catholic ritual, she nevertheless had
it performed in secret, nor did she ever choose by any act
to assent to any other form of religion, her belief in that in
which she was born being so strong, that had the opportunity
offered, she would have displayed it at the stake, her hope
being in God alone, so that she constantly exclaims, ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In te
Domine confido, non confundar in eternam! Si Deus est pro
nobis, quis contra nos?</span></i>’ Her Majesty takes pleasure in playing
on the lute and spinet, and is a very good performer on both
instruments, and indeed before her accession, she taught many
of her maids of honour. But she seems to delight above all in
arraying herself elegantly and magnificently, and her garments
are of two sorts; the one a gown such as men wear,
but fitting very close, with an under petticoat which has a very
long train; and this is her ordinary costume, being also that of
the gentlewomen of England. The other garment is a gown
and boddice with wide hanging sleeves in the French fashion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
which she wears on State occasions, and she also wears much
embroidery, and gowns and mantles of cloth of gold, and cloth
of silver of great value, and changes every day. She also
makes great use of jewels, wearing them both on her chaperon,
and round her neck, and as trimming for her gowns, in which
jewels she delights greatly, and although she has a great
plenty of them left her by her predecessors, yet were she
better supplied with money than she is, she would doubtless
buy more.”<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450"

<p>Philip’s departure for England had been delayed at the
last, on account of the large quantity of bullion he was taking
with him, amounting to 3,000,000 ducats, 300,000 of which
were for his bride, 100,000 for the merchants, and the rest
for the Emperor. In charge of this money was Sir Thomas
Gresham, the celebrated founder of the Royal Exchange, who
had gone to Spain for the purpose of raising a loan. When
that part of the treasure which was destined for England was
taken to the Tower, it filled twenty carts containing fourscore
and seventeen chests, a yard and four inches long, and it was
estimated that when coined it would produce about £50,000
sterling.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451"
class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Both the Emperor and Renard had taken care to give the
Prince good advice as to his behaviour in England. They
dreaded, lest by a repetition of the contempt he had displayed
in Flanders, he should render the marriage still more unpopular
than it already was. They implored him to make
at least a show of cordiality towards the nobles, and to be
affable and condescending to the people. He should force
himself to learn a few words of English, to salute them with,
but at the same time, it would not be amiss, said his mentors,
if he wore a coat of mail under his dress.<a name="FNanchor_452_452"
id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th July, the Spanish fleet being anchored in
Southampton Bay, Philip sent the Prince of Gonzaga and
Count Egmont to inform Mary of his arrival and good health.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
The next morning, he was landed at Southampton in the
Queen’s yacht. As he stepped on shore, a royal salute was
fired, and the Earl of Arundel invested him with the Order
of the Garter,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453"
class="fnanchor">[453]</a> which was at once put on and fastened by a
herald. A brilliant company had assembled at the landing-place,
to receive and do him honour. “God save your Grace,”
was heard on all sides.</p>

<p>Philip presented a gallant enough appearance in his usual
costume of black, with the short Spanish cape worn over one
shoulder, and on his head a berretta with gold chains and a
waving plume. Mary had sent him an Andalusian genet
richly caparisoned, and as the reins were handed to him, Sir
Anthony Browne<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454"
class="fnanchor">[454]</a> advanced, and made a speech in Latin, to
the effect that he had been appointed equerry to the Prince,
and had taken the oath to the imperial ambassador, and
begged to be received as his Highness’s most humble, faithful
and loyal servant. Having kissed the stirrup, he helped the
Prince to mount.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455"
class="fnanchor">[455]</a> As Philip rode through the town, the
spectators remarked with admiration, his graceful horsemanship
and smiling countenance, an indication that he had taken
Renard’s counsels to heart. His first visit was to the Church
of the Holy Rood, where he heard Mass, and returned thanks
for his prosperous voyage and safe arrival.</p>

<p>He was then conducted to the house that had been prepared
for his reception, during his stay at Southampton. Here
his apartments were hung with some famous Flemish arras of
immense value, that had belonged to Henry VIII. A chair
of state in crimson velvet, embroidered with gold and pearls,
stood on a daïs, under a canopy in the principal room. Before
dismissing his escort, composed of nearly every member of
the Privy Council, he addressed them in a Latin speech, in
which he said he had come to live among them, not as a
foreigner, but as a native Englishman, and not from want of
men or money, but God had called him to marry their virtuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
sovereign; and in thanking them for their expressions of faith
and loyalty, he promised that they should ever find him a
grateful, affable and loving Prince.</p>

<p>To the Spanish nobles in his suite, he said that he hoped,
so long as they remained in England, they would conform
to the customs of the country, and in this he would give them
an example. As he finished speaking, he raised to his lips
a flagon of English ale, which he then tasted for the first time,
and drank farewell to the company.<a name="FNanchor_456_456"
id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
Perhaps he disliked it
less than some of his followers; at all events it was observed
that he drank bravely, and without wincing.</p>

<p>As soon as the news of Philip’s arrival reached London,
demonstrations of joy were set on foot, forced upon the
people, said de Noailles maliciously, under pain of death.<a name="FNanchor_457_457"
id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
But it did not appear that they evinced any serious objection
to being feasted and amused. Bells were rung, salvos of
artillery fired, and processions formed to all the principal
churches. Fireworks were displayed, and tables groaning
with viands were laid out in the streets, for every one to eat
as much as he pleased. Wine and ale flowed in abundance.</p>

<p>On the 21st, Mary with her whole court made her entry
into Winchester, where she was to receive the Prince and to be
married to him.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458"
class="fnanchor">[458]</a> She took up her residence at the Bishop’s
palace.</p>

<p>Philip, meanwhile, by his condescension had been making
a favourable impression. So anxious was he to ingratiate
himself with the English, that he gave offence to his own
suite. Every time he went out, he was escorted by Englishmen;
Englishmen served him at table; he breakfasted and
dined in public, according to English custom, although he
disliked it extremely, and drank toasts valiantly in tankards
of strong ale, in the English fashion, encouraging the Spaniards
to do the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 23rd, the Earl of Pembroke with 200 mounted
gentlemen arrived to conduct him to Winchester. With
them were a company of English archers, wearing the
colours of Arragon, with tunics of yellow cloth striped with
crimson velvet, and with cordons of white and crimson silk.
Before Philip left Southampton the Spanish fleet that had
accompanied him was ordered to sail to Flanders immediately
after the marriage ceremony, not a man belonging
to it being allowed to set foot on English soil.<a name="FNanchor_459_459"
id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>The day of his departure was stormy, and it rained in
torrents. He mounted his horse early in the afternoon, but
had not left Southampton far behind, when a horseman
came galloping to meet him, bringing a ring from Mary,
with the entreaty that he would not expose himself to the
inclemency of the weather, but would defer his arrival at
Winchester till the following day. Not at first understanding
the message, Philip thought that he was being warned of some
danger, and stopped to consult with Alva and Egmont; but
when Mary’s solicitude had been explained to him by an interpreter,
he only wrapped his scarlet cloak more closely round
him, pulled down his broad beaver over his eyes, and pressed
gallantly forward, in spite of the elements. His company was
increased at every bend of the road, by the country gentlemen
of Hampshire, who turned out to form an escort; and by the
time he arrived at his destination, his suite numbered several
thousands. Drenched with rain, they were received at the gates
of Winchester by the Mayor and Aldermen, in their civic robes,
who after presenting Philip with the keys of the city, conducted
him to the residence prepared for him in the Dean’s house.<a name="FNanchor_460_460"
id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a></p>

<p>John Elder’s letter, describing Philip’s reception at Winchester
and his marriage, takes up the story probably about
an hour after his entry.</p>

<p>“Then the next Monday, which was the 24th July, his
Highness came to the city of Winchester, at 6 of the clock at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
night, the noblemen of England, and his nobles riding, one
with another before him, in good order, through the city,
every one placed according to his vocation and office, he
riding on a fair white horse, in a rich coat, embroidered with
gold, his doublet, hosen and hat suite-like, with a white
feather in his hat, very fair. And after he lighted, he came
the highway towards the west door of the cathedral church,
where he was most reverently received with procession, by
my lord the Bishop of Winchester, now lord chancellor of
England, and five other bishops, mitred, coped and staved,
where also, after he had kneeled, kissed the crucifix, and done
his prayer, he ascended from thence five steps upon a
scaffold, which was made for the solemnization of his marriage;
and until he came to the choir door, the procession
sang <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laus honor et virtus</span></i>. And after he had entered the
choir, and perceived the most holy sacrament, he put off his
cap, and went bare-headed, with great humility, until he
entered his seat or traverse as they call it, where after he had
kneeled, my lord Chancellor began <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum laudamus</span></i>, and
the choir together with the organs sang and played the rest.
Which being done, he was brought with torch-light to the
Dean’s house, the lords going before him, and the Queen’s
guard in their rich coats standing all the way. Which house
was very gorgeously prepared for him, adjoining to my lord the
Bishop of Winchester’s palace, where the Queen’s Highness
then lay, not passing a pair of but-length’s between. This
night, after he had supped, at 10 of the clock (as I am credibly
informed) he was brought by the counsel a privy way to the
Queen, where her grace very lovingly, yea and most joyfully
received him. And after they had talked together half an
hour,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461"
class="fnanchor">[461]</a> they kissed and departed. I am credibly informed also
that at his departing, he desired the Queen’s Highness to teach
him what he should say to the lords in English at his departing;
and she told him he should say ‘Good night, my lords all’. And
as he came by the lords, he said as the Queen had taught him.”<a name="FNanchor_462_462"
id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>The writer goes on to say, that the next day, being
Tuesday, the Prince made his first public and official visit to
the Queen, at three o’clock in the afternoon, conducted by the
Earl of Derby, the Earl of Pembroke and others, he walking
alone behind them all, “in a cloak of black cloth embroidered
with silver, and a pair of white hose”. He entered the
courtyard of the bishop’s palace, to the sound of music played
by every kind of instrument, and passed into the great hall.
Here Mary received him, and kissed him in presence of all
the people. Taking him by the hand, she led him into the
presence chamber, where after conversing with her for a
quarter of an hour, under the cloth of estate, “to the great
comfort and rejoicing of the beholders,” Philip took his leave
and went to Evensong at the Cathedral, returning afterwards
by torch-light to his lodging.</p>

<p>The following day, 25th July, Feast of St. James, the
patron saint of Spain, was fixed for the marriage. The
Cathedral was entirely hung with arras and cloth of gold.
From the west entrance to the rood-screen, separating the
nave from the chancel, a platform had been erected for the
first part of the service. Under the rood-loft, on either side,
a canopied seat called a <i>traverse</i>, draped with cloth of gold,
was placed for the royal bride and bridegroom. Similar seats
were also placed for them within the choir, in front of the
altar. At about eleven o’clock, Philip, accompanied by his
suite, and wearing a white doublet and trunk hose, a mantle
of cloth of gold, ornamented with pearls and precious stones,
which Mary had sent him, the collar of the Golden Fleece,
and the brilliant blue ribbon of the Garter, entered by the
western door, to the sound of trumpets, and proceeded to his
place under the rood-loft. After waiting for half an hour,
he was joined by the Queen, who wore a dress of white
satin, scarlet shoes, and a mantle of cloth of gold, studded
and fringed with diamonds of great price. Before her walked
the Earl of Derby, bearing the sword of state.</p>

<p>Hundreds of spectators, from all parts of Christendom,
attired with great magnificence, crowded the church, and
made the sight one of dazzling splendour. When the bride
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and bridegroom reached their respective <i>traverses</i>, says the
chronicler, they were shriven,<a name="FNanchor_463_463"
id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>
and afterwards stood up together
by the rood, the Bishops of Winchester, London,
Durham, Chichester, Lincoln and Ely, preceded by their
croziers, having come from the choir to that place. But
before the ceremony began, Don Juan Figueroa, Regent of
Naples, and a member of the Emperor’s Council, handed to
the English Chancellor two instruments, by which Charles V.
made over to his son his sovereignty over the kingdom of
Naples, and the Duchy of Milan, so that, as Gardiner at once
declared to the assembly, “it was thought the Queen’s Majesty
should marry but with a prince; now it was manifested that
she should marry with a king”.<a name="FNanchor_464_464"
id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>Then the banns were bidden, in Latin and in English,
and the marriage was solemnised, the Queen standing on the
right side, the King on the left, while the Marquis of Winchester,
the Earls of Derby, Bedford and Pembroke gave her
to her husband, in the name of the whole realm. The nuptial
blessing was pronounced by Gardiner, who was the officiating
prelate in default of the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p>“Then all the people gave a great shout, praying God to
send them joy, and the ring being laid upon the book to be
hallowed, the Prince laid also upon the said book, three handfuls
of fine gold, which the lady Margaret<a name="FNanchor_465_465"
id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> seeing, opened the
Queen’s purse, and the Queen smilingly put up in the same
purse. And when they had enclosed their hands, immediately
the sword was advanced before the King, by the Earl of
Pembroke.”<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466"
class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The marriage ring was a plain hoop of gold
without any stone, for the Queen had said: “she would be
married as maidens were in the old time, and so she was”.<a name="FNanchor_467_467"
id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>“After the marriage knot thus knit, the King and Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
came hand in hand, under a rich canopy, being borne over
them with six knights, and two swords before them, all the
lords both English and strangers, richly apparelled going
afore them, the trumpets then blowing, till they came into
the choir, where all the priests and singing men, all in rich
copes, began to sing a psalm used in marriages, the King and
Queen kneeling a while before the altar, each of them having
a taper afore them. Then after, her Majesty went into her
traverse on the right side, and the King into another on the
left side; after the Gospel, they came out, and kneeled before
the altar openly all the Mass time, and the care-cloth was
holden over them; and he kissed the bishop at the <i>Agnus</i>
and then her Majesty. The Mass done, the King of Heralds
openly in the church, and in presence of the King, the Queen,
the lords and ladies, and all the people, solemnly proclaimed
their Majesties King and Queen, with their title and style in
manner as followeth: Philip and Mary by the grace of God,
King and Queen of England, France, Naples, Jerusalem,
Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Princes of Spain and Sicily,
Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Milan, Burgundy and Brabant,
Counts of Hapsburg, Flanders and Tyrol.”<a name="FNanchor_468_468"
id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>At three o’clock, the royal procession left the Cathedral,
and the King and Queen walked hand in hand to the
banqueting hall. According to the Spanish accounts of the
banquet, none were seated at the royal table but the King
and Queen. Some of the English chronicles state that a third
place was assigned to Gardiner, the only dignitary admitted
to their table. Farther off, tables occupying the whole length
of the room were placed for the members of the court, the
foreign ambassadors, Philip’s suite and the other guests. De
Noailles had absented himself from the whole of the marriage
ceremonies, judging that it was beneath his master’s dignity
for the imperial ambassador to take precedence of him.
Edward Underhill thus describes the banquet:—</p>

<p>“On the marriage day, the King and the Queen dined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
in the hall in the bishops palace, sitting under the cloth of
estate, and none else at that table. The nobility sat at the
side tables. We (the gentlemen pensioners) were the chief
servitors to carry the meat, and the Earl of Sussex, our captain,
was the shewer. The second course at the marriage of a
king is given unto the bearers; I mean the meat, but not the
dishes, for they were of gold. It was my chance to carry
a great pasty of red deer, in a great charger, very delicately
baked, which for the weight thereof, divers refused, the which
pasty I sent unto London, to my wife and her brother, who
cheered therewith many of their friends.”<a name="FNanchor_469_469"
id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>At the bottom of the hall was an orchestra, and music
was played during nearly the whole time of the banquet.
Towards the end, the Winchester schoolboys came in, and
some of them recited poems and epithalamiums in honour
of the marriage. The Queen rewarded them handsomely.
After the banquet followed a ball, at which Underhill compared
the Spanish dancing unfavourably with the English,
and especially with that of Lord Braye and Mr. Carew,
a criticism that must certainly be put down to British prejudice.
Before nine o’clock, all had retired, but the feasting
and rejoicing were continued for several days, after which the
King and Queen went to Basinghouse, and thence to Windsor.
Here, a chapter of the Order of the Garter was held,
and Philip was installed. During the preparations for this
ceremony, an overzealous herald hoisted down the arms of
England and substituted those of Spain, but he was peremptorily
ordered to replace them as they were.<a name="FNanchor_470_470"
id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>On the 7th August, a great public hunt was held, with toils
five and six miles long, “and many a deer that day was
brought to the quarry”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>So far, the Emperor and his ministers were satisfied with
the success of their policy. On the 4th August, the Bishop
of Arras wrote to Renard, expressing “incredible content,
that the marriage for which both had worked, for so long, was
accomplished, to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, and
that the King was behaving in every way so well, that he had
gained the approbation of all in England”. He foresaw, he
said, many difficulties still, but hoped that with gentleness and
benignity, they might not prove too great.<a name="FNanchor_471_471"
id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the King and Queen had made their public
entry into London, and although there is nothing in the
records to indicate that the citizens made any hostile demonstration
against Philip, their reception of him cannot have
been altogether gratifying, for after his second visit to the
capital in September, Renard observed:—</p>

<p>“Since the return of the King to London, the vigil of
St. Michael, the citizens have recovered altogether from the
insolence which they at first showed, and seemed to comprehend,
and taste at last, the honour and welfare which
the alliance has brought to England, and the repose and
tranquillity that are the result”.<a name="FNanchor_472_472"
id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>
The nobility, he went on to
say, were beginning to accommodate themselves, and to converse
with the Spaniards, admiring the humanity and virtue of
the King, so that things were more peaceful than usual. At
first, there had been, he said, some embarrassment, because
things had not been arranged properly, but since the Council
had been informed of the difficulty in getting the suite lodged,
they had given such orders, that the citizens no longer objected
to lodge the strangers, and that now all was well, except that
they were made to pay exorbitant rents, which also would be
reformed. It was true, he continued, that the heretics could
not get over the matter of religion, and had been much
troubled by the articles which the Bishop of London (Bonner)
had caused to be printed and published, and notably on
account of the form and name of the Inquisition, in which
they had been conceived, but the publication had continued,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
in spite of murmurs, and they could do nothing, Madam
Elizabeth being under arrest. All their hope now lay in the
Earl of Arundel, who was an enemy of the Chancellor, and
who hoped to marry his son to the Princess.</p>

<p>At the public entry of their Majesties into London, one
small but ominous misadventure has been recorded showing
the drift of Puritan feeling. The streets were gaily decorated,
and the citizens indulged their love of pageantry freely. At
the Conduit in Gracechurch Street, figures had been painted
representing “Nine Worthies,” among whom were Henry
VIII., Edward VI. and Mary. Henry VIII. wore armour,
and had a sword in one hand, while he held a book in the
other. On the book was inscribed in Latin <i>The Word of God</i>.
He was supposed to be handing the Bible to Edward, who
was standing in a corner by his side.</p>

<p>“Hereupon was no small matter made, for the Bishop of
Winchester, lord Chancellor sent for the painter, and not only
called him knave, for painting a book in King Henry’s hand,
and specially for writing thereupon <i>Verbum Dei</i>, but also
rank traitor and villain, saying to him that he should rather
have put the book into the Queen’s hand (who was also
painted there) for that she had reformed the Church and
religion, with other things, according to the pure word of God
indeed. The painter answered and said, that if he had known
that had been the matter wherefore his lordship sent for him
he could have remedied it, and not have troubled his lordship.
The bishop answered and said, that it was the Queen’s
Majesty’s will and commandment, that he should send for
him; and so commanding him to wipe out the book and
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verbum Dei</span></i>, he sent him home. So the painter departed,
but fearing lest he should leave somewhat either of the book
or of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Verbum Dei</span></i> in King Henry’s hand, he wiped away a
piece of his fingers withal.”<a name="FNanchor_473_473"
id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>
<p>Another discordant note was struck by the circumstance
that the Council either by design or accident delayed inviting
the French ambassador to take part in the procession, till half
an hour before the King and Queen set forth from Southwark.
De Noailles received the invitation by means of “a shabby-looking
individual, who said he was one of the newly made
heralds,” and pleaded the shortness of time in which to make
a creditable appearance, and to get himself to Southwark,
a distance of at least two miles from his house.<a name="FNanchor_474_474"
id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Nevertheless,
as soon as might be, he solicited an audience, and
was received by the Queen on the 21st August. On expressing
his congratulations, coupled with regrets at not having
been able to be present at the wedding festivities, like the
other ambassadors, his desires for her prosperity and for
peace between France and England being no less than she
herself could wish, Mary replied that she had not forgotten
what she had said to him at their first interview, relating to
the friendship contracted between the two countries during
her father’s and her brother’s lifetime. She had, she declared,
maintained it intact; and in spite of the troubles in the past,
all things being now settled to her great contentment, she
hoped that the peace for which she had so deep an affection
would never be violated.</p>

<p>On leaving the Queen’s presence, de Noailles proceeded to
an audience with Philip, an occasion of still deeper concern to
him. The following remarks, which he wrote for his master’s
information, reveal the want of good faith and mutual confidence
through the polite speeches made on either side.</p>

<p>“On being conducted to him, I said that I had taken
advantage of the first opportunity to pay my respects to his
Majesty, and to inform him as ambassador of the very Christian
King, residing at the Court of the Queen of England, his good
sister, that their Majesties had hitherto lived, and had caused
their subjects to live, in peace and sincere friendship with each
other. This peace and friendship I trusted, would not be
troubled or diminished by his advent on the throne, but rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
be increased thereby, and that he would as far as possible be
the means of the pacification of all Christendom, as the said
Lady and her Council had often predicted. And I added,
that I prayed our Lord to permit the tranquillity in which his
Highness had found these two realms in their relations with
each other, to continue perpetually. In this case, I said, he
might count on my co-operation as minister and humble
servant of his Majesty, who like a true prince made a point of
observing his promises faithfully. When I had finished my
speech, the said King called the Chancellor, and told him in
Latin, that he had perfectly understood what I had said,
although he could not <i>speak</i> French, and he begged him to
reply to me, and say that both before and since his arrival in
this country, he had sworn and promised to maintain the
alliances which the Kingdom of England had contracted with
neighbouring princes, and in which he had found this realm,
as long as it should be for the good and convenience of England.
He thanked me moreover for the good service which I
had offered to do in this matter, and for the trouble I had taken
in coming to see him, his answer being clearly forged in the
Emperor’s, as well as in the English smithy, as one may see,
by the pains they take to show that they are not wanting in
the will to make war on the first convenient occasion.”<a name="FNanchor_475_475"
id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>But Mary at least was anxious for peace, and she wrote to
Henry II. expressing herself in no ambiguous terms on the
subject.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476"
class="fnanchor">[476]</a> At the same time, she knew not how to satisfy all
the various conflicting demands on her justice, her fidelity to
her people, to her husband and to her conscience. Philip had
shown himself so willing, in every way, to respect national
customs and prejudices; he was so careful in his intercourse
with Englishmen to seem to identify his interests with theirs,
that it was felt something must also be conceded to his tastes.
Hitherto the palace gates had been open to all comers; the
Queen was easy of access to the humblest petitioner, and the
Venetian ambassador has recorded that from early morning
till late at night she gave audiences without ceasing. A few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
days after their public entry into London, their Majesties removed
to Hampton Court, where more of Spanish etiquette
and of that aloofness which characterised the majesty of
Spain began to be observed. Before long, there were murmurs
because the hall door within the courtyard was now
kept continually shut, so that no man might enter, unless his
errand were first known, “which seemed strange to Englishmen
that had not been used thereto”.<a name="FNanchor_477_477"
id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<p>Philip may have considered this withdrawal from close
contact with the people a necessity, on account of the unsatisfactory
state of London, which was constantly the scene
of attacks against religious ceremonies, disputes at street
corners, concerning points of doctrine, and the interpretation
of different passages of Scripture. Not unfrequently, the
brawl would end in vituperation of the Queen, of Philip and
of their marriage, in language that was no less than treason.
Renard had repeatedly expressed the opinion that these disturbers
of the public peace should be punished as rebels, and
not as heretics. Such a proceeding would certainly have been
far more diplomatic, although the outrages perpetrated sprang
obviously from religious discontent. The Chancellor and the
Bishop of London ruled that they came within the episcopal
province and jurisdiction, and proceeded against them in the
religious sense, sometimes dispensing with the royal sign
manual altogether. The articles mentioned in Renard’s letter
as having been published by Bonner in September came under
this head. The Council called him to account for having
acted without sufficient warrant, and, above all, without the
seal of their Majesties. Bonner replied, that these were things
dependent on his office and jurisdiction, and that he knew
well, in communicating them to the Council, annoyances and
hindrances would have been put in his way; that he had acted
in the service of God, and that in religious questions one must
advance boldly, without fear. He gave instances from the Old
Testament, to prove that God helped those who upheld His
laws, observed His commandments, and adhered faithfully to
Him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>
<p>Later on, the Council altered their tactics, and Bonner was
accused of dilatoriness in examining heretics.</p>

<p>Gardiner, preaching at Paul’s Cross, about this time, inveighed
against the prevailing heresies, but in such a manner
that his audience took his words in good part, although there
were more than ten thousand persons present. He touched
discreetly on the Queen’s marriage, and had it not been for
Bonner’s articles, the agitation in London would have gradually
subsided. But the disturbances which they caused became so
serious, and the people remonstrated to such purpose, that they
were temporarily withdrawn. Even then, the Londoners were
not satisfied, erroneously connecting the Bishop’s measures
with Spanish policy, and clamouring for the arrival of Reginald
Pole, who, in spite of his long exile, was known to be a thorough
Englishman at heart, and to have been disinclined to the
Queen’s marriage.</p>

<p>But although, when once the alliance was an accomplished
fact, the Emperor’s zeal for the salvation of souls appeared
suddenly to awake, and although he expressed keen anxiety
that the Papal Legate should proceed at once to his mission in
England,<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478"
class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Pole was still prevented from accomplishing it.
His desire to return to his native land was as great as that of
his fellow-countrymen for his presence among them, and on
the 21st September, he wrote to Philip, complaining that it
was now a year since he commenced knocking at his palace
gate, nor as yet had any one opened it to him. Were the
King to ask, “Who knocks?” he would reply, “I am he, who
in order not to exclude your consort from the throne of England,
endured expulsion from home and country, and twenty
years of exile”. Were he merely to say this much, would he
not seem worthy to return to the land of his birth, and to
have access to the King? But as he was not acting in his
own name, nor as a private person, he knocked and demanded
in the name and person of the vicegerent of the King of kings
and the Pastor of man, namely, the successor of Peter, or
rather of Peter himself, whose authority, heretofore so flourishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
and vigorous in England, was now most injuriously ejected
thence. Through Pole, Peter had long been knocking at the
royal gate, which although open to others, was still closed to
him alone. The voice perhaps was not heard? Continuing
in the same strain, he expostulated with Philip and Mary, and
concluded by saying that if he personally were not acceptable,
he begged that another might be summoned in his stead.<a name="FNanchor_479_479"
id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>

<p>Few, conversant with the celebrities of the sixteenth century,
will fail to see in Reginald Pole the most distinguished
Englishman of his day. Of royal descent, a notable scholar
and a man whose conscience ruled every action of his life, he
voluntarily exiled himself, when, at the cost of a single principle,
the highest preferments in Church or State lay open to
him. Two passions marked his singularly blameless career:
love of his country and devotion to the Holy See. He turned
his back on the one, when the King renounced the other, and
made it high treason to continue to acknowledge the Pope
Head of the Church of England. We have seen that when
Pole refused to return to England he was declared a traitor, a
price was put upon his head, and his aged mother was brought
to the block.</p>

<p>Paul III. made him a Cardinal, in order to avail himself
of his knowledge and brilliant talents at the Council of Trent,
and at the death of that Pontiff, he was the imperial candidate
for the Papacy. Had he possessed a particle of ambition he
might have controlled the Conclave.</p>

<p>On Mary’s accession, he wrote many urgent appeals to
the Queen, beseeching her to lose no time in riveting the
broken chain between England and Rome. He possessed
undoubted influence with her, but less than the Emperor,
who counselled delay, and took care that the interests of the
empire should before all be secured. The eldest son of the
Church, Charles ever made religion the handmaid of politics;
and as for Philip, in spite of his boasted maxim, that it would
be better not to reign at all, than to reign over a nation of
heretics, he was content always to play a waiting game, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
above all to follow his father’s lead. Pole, in common with
Gardiner, had considered that Mary was fatally mistaken in
allying herself with Spain, that the English would have been
far more easily reconciled to Rome if every other foreign
element had been excluded, and confidence in herself planted
on a firm and solid basis, and that, at all events, the re-establishment
of Papal jurisdiction should have been her first
care in ascending the throne. If, when the kingdom was at
her feet, she had freed herself from the Emperor’s influence,
and had summoned Pole in his official capacity as Papal
Legate, he believed that the movement towards reunion would
have been a truly national one.</p>

<p>In many ways, Pole’s opinion was justified by facts. The
enthusiasm with which Mary had been greeted, although
perhaps mainly owing to the affection she inspired, was also
in no small measure due to the recoil of the people from the
innovations of Edward’s reign, innovations that had abounded
in disillusion, and that had set the hearts of many burning
within them with desire for the old religion. But de Noailles,
Suffolk, Wyatt and others, had successfully availed themselves
of the unpopularity of the Queen’s contemplated marriage
to rouse the Puritan minority against her throne, and her
religion; and the Emperor, knowing Pole’s opinions, and
being well aware of the weight they would have in England,
detained the Legate till all dread of his interference was at
an end.</p>

<p>Great as was his disappointment at the enforced delay,
Pole was not the man to resent or resist the obstacles put
in his way. He did what he could, to fulfil his secondary mission,
which was to promote peace between the King of France
and the Emperor; and he conferred diligently with the royal
and imperial ministers, on the possibility of a <i>modus vivendi</i>
between the two powers. From Brussels he went to Paris
and made a favourable impression on Henry II., but failing to
bring about the desired object, returned to the Netherlands.
Charles received him coolly, believing him to have been the
author of an intercepted letter, which had been actually
written by one of his suite, to the Queen of England, dissuading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
her from marrying Philip. But this gave Pole the
opportunity of assuring the Emperor, that he was convinced
the Queen’s decision had been taken with the highest motives
for the sake of religion, and in order to secure the royal
succession, and that such being the case, he cordially approved
it.<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480"
class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Philip was now in England, and the Legate, like the
Chancellor, made the best of what could no longer be avoided.
Difficulties other than those concerning the empire kept him
still an exile. They were of two kinds, one relating to himself
personally, the other having reference to the religious
state of England. The personal difficulty was the fact of his
being still an outlaw, and as regarded the other, until there
was some prospect of the accomplishment of his mission, it
would be useless for him to cross the Channel.</p>

<p>The first, but least formidable barrier to the reunion of
the kingdom with Rome, arose from the opposition of a small
party unfavourable to Papal jurisdiction. This party was
confined almost exclusively to London, and to parts of the
southern and eastern counties, but wherever isolated bodies
of Puritans were to be found scattered up and down the
country, the same opposition naturally prevailed. The great
masses of country gentlefolk had become, in consequence of
the frequent changes of religion, indifferent to every form of
faith; they would have been ready, at the call of the Sovereign,
to embrace Judaism or Mohammedanism if their convenience
or interest required it. The yeomanry, farmers and peasantry
were nearly everywhere intensely Catholic, but especially in
the north, where also a considerable number of landed gentry
were ready to suffer all things in defence of the old religion.
But another class had sprung up in the course of twenty-five
years, consisting of almost every second wealthy family in the
kingdom, enriched, in many cases entirely built up, from the
spoils of the churches and monasteries. And these would
never consent to any religious authority that might call their
right to them in question. Cardinal Pole was known to be opposed
to any recognition of the title of these lay proprietors;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
and without wasting efforts at this crisis, in an attempt to induce
Parliament to reverse Pole’s attainder, the Chancellor appealed
to the Pope for a bull, confirming them in their possessions.</p>

<p>In reply to the before-mentioned letter, in which Pole
spoke of his having been kept knocking a whole year at the
palace gates, Philip sent Renard to Brussels to negotiate.
Having graphically described the state of the country, proving
to the Legate that a general and immediate restitution was
out of the question, Renard persuaded him to leave the
matter for a time in abeyance. Meanwhile Julius III. signed
a bull, empowering the Legate to give, alienate and transfer to
the actual holders, all property which had been torn from the
Church during the reigns of Henry VIII. and Edward VI.
The Pope had considered, after consulting with canonists,
that the continued alienation of Church property was justifiable,
if it proved the means of restoring the realm to the faith.</p>

<p>This difficulty being settled, on Renard’s return to England,
the Lords Paget and Hastings were sent to bring the Legate
home. Sir William Cecil accompanied them, but in an unofficial
capacity, probably because, having become a Catholic,
he would be a <i>persona grata</i> to Pole, and also to the Emperor
on account of his moderate views.<a name="FNanchor_481_481"
id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>Parliament met on the 12th November, and a bill was
brought forward to reverse Pole’s attainder. It set forth that
the sole cause of his disgrace was his refusal to consent to
the unlawful divorce of the Queen’s father and mother, and in
order that the repeal might be clearly understood as an act of
justice, and not of grace, the cause was rejudged, the result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
being that both Houses repealed the attainder, and restored
all his rights and privileges. The Great Seal put to this Act
was, for more distinction, taken off in gold. Pole was then
free to return to his native land, and was received at Dover
on the 20th, with the honours due to a royal person. From
Gravesend, he sailed up the Thames in the Queen’s barge, his
silver cross at the prow, a crowd of smaller boats flying gala
colours. At Westminster, the Chancellor welcomed him at
the landing place, and conducted him to the palace. Their
Majesties rose from dinner to greet him, receiving him at the
top of the great staircase.</p>

<p>After delivering the briefs of his legation, he retired to the
archiepiscopal palace at Lambeth, which had been prepared
for his reception. Three days later, a royal message summoned
the Lords and Commons to the court, where the
Legate, in a long speech, acknowledged the act of justice done
to him, invited the nation to a sincere repentance of its past
errors, and exhorted the members of both Houses to receive
with joy the reconciliation which he was charged by Christ’s
Vicegerent here on earth to impart to them. As they, by
repealing Acts made against him, had opened his country to
him once more, so he was invested with full power to receive
them back into the Church of God. He then retired, and the
Chancellor addressed them, in a discourse beginning with the
words, “The Lord shall raise up a prophet to thee from
amongst thine own brethren,” making an allusion to himself
as having been among the number of the delinquents. He
urged them to rise from their fallen state, and to seek reconciliation
with the common parent of all Christians.</p>

<p>The next day, both Houses passed a unanimous resolution
to return to the communion of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>On the 30th, Feast of St. Andrew the Apostle, the King
sent the Earl of Arundel with six knights of the Garter and
six prelates to escort the Legate to the House of Lords. He
took his place at the Queen’s right hand, the King being on
her left, but nearer to her. The Commons having been sent
for, Gardiner recapitulated what he had before said, asking
all present if they ratified his words, and desired to return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
the unity of the Catholic Church and to the obedience owed
to her chief pastor. The shouts and acclamations of the
whole assembly answered him. He then handed a petition
to the King and Queen, on behalf of both Houses of Parliament,
as representatives of the nation, declaring their sorrow
for the schism, and all that had been done against the See of
Rome and the Catholic religion, requesting their Majesties
to obtain of the Lord Legate, pardon and restoration, as true
and living members to that body from which they had separated
themselves by misdeeds.</p>

<p>When this petition had been read and returned to the
Chancellor, who then read it aloud in the hearing of all, both
Houses rose as one man, and went towards the Legate. He
stepped forward to meet them, while the Queen, in her own
name, and in that of the nation, petitioned him to grant them
the pardon and reconciliation sued for. The Legate in a
somewhat lengthy speech reminded them of the thanks due
to divine Providence for this further proof of forbearance, and
of the favour shown to England. Then the whole assembly
fell prostrate, except the King and Queen, and the Cardinal
pronounced the words of absolution, “from all heresy and
schism, and all judgments, censures and penalties, for that
cause incurred; and restored them to the communion of
holy Church, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost”. “Amen” resounded from every part of the House,
and the members rising from their knees, followed the royal
procession into the chapel, where they returned thanks by
chanting a solemn <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</span></i>.<a name="FNanchor_482_482"
id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>This apparent fervour was for the most part only on the
surface. Had Pole not returned armed with a Papal dispensation,
exonerating all the possessors of ecclesiastical plunder
from the necessity of restoring it, he would have been received
in a very different spirit. It was not possible to bring back
the ages of faith to a generation that had grown sceptical
from change and worldliness, and both Houses consisted
largely of this class of people. When the question of restoring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Church lands had come under discussion before the
Papal dispensation had been published, the Earl of Bedford
fell into a violent passion, and breaking his rosary beads from
his girdle flung them into the fire, declaring that he valued
his sweet abbey of Woburn more than fatherly counsel that
should come from Rome.<a name="FNanchor_483_483"
id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
Although Sir William Cecil might
have expressed himself less warmly, he certainly shared this
sentiment, in regard to his benefices of Putney, Mortlake and
Wimbledon; and the express mention of the lands held by
Sir William Petre and the confirmation of his title to them in
the bull of Paul IV. are sufficient proof of the Chief Secretary’s
unwillingness to part with the monastic property that
had fallen to his share.<a name="FNanchor_484_484"
id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
And these men were fairly representative
of all those who had been enriched in this way. It
was to such as these that Pole addressed his earnest admonition
concerning the sacred vessels of the altar, that they might
not be put to profane uses, while he entreated all those who
were in possession of ecclesiastical revenues, “through the
bowels of mercy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that
from a regard to their own eternal lot, they would provide
out of the Church lands, such especially as had been set aside
for the maintenance of the parochial clergy, a competent
subsistence for those who exercised that charge, which might
enable them to live creditably, according to their state, and
perform their functions, and support the burden of their calling”.
On the first Sunday of Advent, he made his public
entry into London, and heard High Mass at St. Paul’s. Gardiner
on this occasion preached his famous sermon, in which
he accused himself bitterly of his conduct under Henry VIII.,
and exhorted all who had fallen with him, or through his
example, to rise with him, and return to the religion of their
forefathers.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485"
class="fnanchor">[485]</a> He took as the text of his discourse a part
of the eleventh verse of the thirteenth chapter of St. Paul’s
Epistle to the Romans, “It is the hour to rise out of sleep”.
On the following Thursday, both Houses of Convocation waited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
on the Cardinal at Lambeth, and kneeling, received absolution
“from all their perjuries, schism and heresies”.<a name="FNanchor_486_486"
id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a></p>

<p>To Mary the moment seemed to rain blessings. God
was operating miracles of grace in her favour. From the
midst of perils that had surrounded her from her childhood
upwards, from ignominy such as the lowest in the land had
never known, she had been raised to the throne. Those who
had taken up arms against her had been twice signally defeated.
By a marriage which she had contracted in spite of
the most violent prejudice and opposition, she had allied her
beloved country to the most powerful empire in the world,
and now she had been the means, not only of restoring to it
its birthright, but had thereby, in a certain sense, expiated
and undone her father’s sin. To crown her glory, she was
about to become a mother, and secure a long succession of
Catholic monarchs to the throne. She had longed for it, and
had hoped for some time; on the day of the Legate’s arrival
she thought that she knew it as certain, and applied to herself
the words of St. Elizabeth, on hearing the salutation of
the Blessed Virgin.</p>

<p>Philip lost no time in informing the Pope of the happy
issue of his solicitude for the conversion of England. On
the very day of the reunion he wrote as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">To our most holy Father</span>,</p>

<p>“Most holy Father, I have already written to Dom
John Manrique, to inform your Holiness of the good condition
of religious affairs in this kingdom, and of the manner
in which all things were tending to render you obedience, and
which I hoped for with the help of our Lord. Now that the
matter is accomplished, I must rejoice with you, and inform
you that to-day, feast of St. Andrew, in the assembly which
represents the kingdom, all have unanimously testified deep
regret for the past, and have declared their obedience to your
Holiness, and to the Holy See, afterwards by the intercession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
of the Queen, receiving the absolution which the Cardinal Legate
pronounced. He will tell your Holiness all that passed.
As for me, the devout son of your Holiness, I confess that I
have never felt more joy than in seeing how, during the life
of your Holiness, a kingdom like this has returned to the
bosom of the Church, and I can but give thanks to God, to
whom I also pray to preserve and prosper your Holiness.</p>

<p>“London, 30 November 1554. Your Holiness’s very
humble son, <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_487_487"
id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p></div>

<p>De Noailles was still doing his old work of sowing dissension
broadcast, and he flattered himself, and assured
Henry, that the country was on the verge of another revolt.
But here his eager enmity misled him, and his despatches
about this time are exceedingly untrustworthy. The fact is
that Mary’s enemies were for a moment awed into some
degree of loyalty, by what was then regarded as a wonderful
succession of outward and visible signs of the Divine protection;
and apart from the friction caused by the presence of
so many Spaniards in London, the city had not been in so
peaceable a condition for many months. But Philip’s suite
and the servants of his servants were far less careful than the
King was himself not to offend the national susceptibilities,
and on the slightest provocation, the Spaniards produced
their knives. It is recorded that on “Friday, the 26th day
of October, there was a Spaniard hanged at Charing Cross,
which had shamefully slain an Englishman, servant to Sir
George Gifford. There would have been given 500 crowns of
the strangers to have saved his life.”<a name="FNanchor_488_488"
id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> On the 11th January,
1555, a Spaniard was hanged for running an Englishman
through with a rapier, whilst two Spaniards held him by
the arms.<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489"
class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Affrays were of constant occurrence between
Englishmen and Spaniards, and Philip issued a proclamation
to the effect that the first Spaniard who should dare to use a
weapon was to have his hand cut off. Henceforth, none of
his compatriots were to carry arms, and any who should raise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the cry of <i>Spain</i> for assistance, either in defence or offence,
should be hanged.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490"
class="fnanchor">[490]</a> On the other hand, the wealth of the
Spaniards tempted the English; and on the 26th April, 1555,
three men were hanged at Charing Cross, for robbing them of
a treasure of gold, out of Westminster Abbey.<a name="FNanchor_491_491"
id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Cardinal Pole, in the report which he sent to Julius III.
of the ceremony in Parliament on St. Andrew’s Day, prognosticated
nothing but good for the future of the country. After
bestowing much praise on the King and Queen, he continues
rather quaintly: “Philip is the spouse of Mary, but treats her
so deferentially as to appear her son, thus giving promise of
the best result. Mary has spiritually generated England, before
giving birth to that heir of whom there is very great hope.”<a name="FNanchor_492_492"
id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
The Pope’s response to this eulogy was the sending to Mary
of the golden rose, and to Philip the sword and hat which
sometimes accompanied it, when the Pope desired to honour in
this manner both a King and a Queen. The Venetian ambassador
thus chronicled the event. Writing on the 26th March
1555 he says: “Three days ago, there arrived here Monsignor
Antonio Agustini, auditor di Rota, sent by the Pope to visit
and thank their Majesties for the auspicious events of the
religion, and to present them with the rose, sword and hat
which his Holiness is in the habit of sending to one prince
or another; and so yesterday, the day of the Annunciation
and commencement of the year, according to the English
style, the ceremony was performed in the private chapel of
her Majesty’s palace, there being present the most illustrious
Legate, all the ambassadors, and the lords of the Court.
Monsignor Agostini (<i>sic</i>) after the Mass, presented the rose
to the most serene Queen, and the sword and hat to the most
serene King, accompanying the presents with a brief from
his Holiness, which was read in public, replete with praise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
their Majesties, and of his Holiness’s great love and affection
for them; and the most illustrious Legate, in his episcopal
habit, with mitre and cope, having recited certain prayers
over the presents, and given the usual benediction, the most
serene Queen evinced the utmost delight at hers, for after a
short prayer, she carried it in her own hand, and placed it
on its altar.”<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493"
class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of her joy and hope, Mary was mindful of
the afflicted. Many were still in the Tower for having been
implicated in Wyatt’s rebellion. They would have been
liberated at her marriage, but it had been thought that the fear
of death might induce them to make important confessions.
They were however released in January 1555, under personal
recognisances for their future good behaviour, subject to the
payment of sundry fines. Several of them were, notwithstanding,
engaged in another rebellious enterprise, a few
months later.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494"
class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth was not forgotten in the clemency so generally
extended. She too must feel the effect of the wonderful dawn
of happiness that was at last tinging all Mary’s existence with
a rosy light. Even before her marriage, the Queen had
wished to restore her sister to liberty. But the problem as
to what should be done with her was not easy to solve. She
had thought of sending her to the Low Countries, where
under the eye of the widowed Queen of Hungary, Philip’s
aunt, even Elizabeth would find it difficult to do much mischief.
Then a marriage was proposed for her with Philibert
Emmanuel, Duke of Savoy.</p>

<p>Closely as she was guarded by Sir Henry Bedingfeld, de
Noailles found means to communicate with her, and to advise
her against this union. He feared that she might consent to
anything, in order to regain her liberty. The Duke was a disinherited
prince, and the project of marrying her to him was
nothing but a scheme for expatriating her, perhaps even for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
depriving her of the hope she might entertain of one day
succeeding to the throne.<a name="FNanchor_495_495"
id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Hereupon Elizabeth at once refused the Duke, without
ever having seen him. He had arrived in England during
the Christmas holidays, leaving at the beginning of January,
and she was not released from captivity at Woodstock until
the following April.<a name="FNanchor_496_496"
id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of that month, Mary went to Hampton
Court, where she intended to await her confinement. On the
17th, Sir Henry Bedingfeld received an order to convey the
Lady Elizabeth to that place with all despatch, together with
her servants and her customary guard.<a name="FNanchor_497_497"
id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
The journey lasted
four days, the third day being marked by a demonstration in
her favour, on the part of sixty of her tenants at Colnebrook.
But Bedingfeld, in the Queen’s name, ordered them all to
retire, and allowed none but her three women, an officer, two
men-servants, and a gentleman of her wardrobe to approach
her. She arrived at Hampton Court on the 29th, and was
lodged in the apartment just then vacated by the Duke of
Alva, adjoining that of the King. All communication from
outside was cut off, and Bedingfeld’s soldiers mounted guard
over her. Her seclusion was almost as great as it had been
at Woodstock. She was not permitted to see the Queen,
but according to documents discovered a few years ago, and,
of course, unknown to the early writers on this reign, Philip
visited her within a few days of her arrival.<a name="FNanchor_498_498"
id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>
<p>“The next day 29 April, Madam Elizabeth came to this
Court, whom the King went to visit two or three days after.
She had been told beforehand by the Queen her sister, to
be dressed as richly as possible, to receive the visit of the said
King.”</p>

<p>What was said at this interview never transpired, but it is
certain that not a word passed Elizabeth’s lips, that could
be construed into a willingness to play the part of a repentant
sinner. A demeanour of injured and haughty innocence had
served the accused Princess well, when she was in imminent
danger, and a prisoner in the Tower. She had found it
successful at Woodstock, and it was not likely that now,
when she was on the threshold of freedom, she would abate
one iota of her dignity. She knew that if there had been
evidence against her sufficient to convict, she would have
been convicted long ago, and she knew also that without that
evidence her life was safe. After a fortnight of solitude, she
was allowed to see her great-uncle, Lord William Howard,
whom she begged to procure her the favour of an interview
with some members of the Privy Council. Accordingly, a few
days later, Gardiner, Arundel, Shrewsbury and Petre paid her
a visit. Foxe says:—</p>

<p>“Stephen Gardiner, the Bishop of Winchester, kneeled
down, and requested that she would submit herself to the
queen’s grace; and in so doing, he had no doubt but that her
majesty would be good to her. She made answer that rather
than she would so do, she would lie in prison all the days of
her life; adding that she craved no mercy at her majesty’s
hand, but rather desired the law, if ever she did offend her
majesty in thought, word or deed. ‘And besides this, in
yielding,’ quoth she, ‘I should speak against myself, and
confess myself to be an offender, which I never was towards her
majesty, by occasion whereof, the King and the Queen might
ever hereafter conceive of me an evil opinion. And therefore I
say, my lords, it were better for me to lie in prison for the truth,
than to be abroad and suspected of my prince.’ And so they
departed, promising to declare her message to the queen.</p>

<p>“On the next day, the bishop of Winchester came again
unto her grace, and kneeling down, declared that the queen
marvelled that she would so stoutly use herself, not confessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
that she had offended: so that it should seem that the queen’s
majesty had wrongfully imprisoned her grace. ‘Nay,’ quoth
the lady Elizabeth, ‘it may please her to punish me as she
thinketh good.’ ‘Well,’ quoth Gardiner, ‘her majesty willeth
me to tell you, that you must tell another tale, or that you be
set at liberty.’ Her grace answered, that she had as lieve be
in prison with honesty and truth, as to be abroad suspected of
her majesty: ‘and this that I have said, I will,’ said she, ‘stand
unto: for I will never belie myself’. Winchester again kneeled
down, and said, ‘Then your grace hath the vantage of me,
and other the lords, for your wrong and long imprisonment’.
‘What vantage I have,’ quoth she, ‘you know: taking God
to record I seek no vantage at your hands, for your so dealing
with me; but God forgive you and me also!’ With that the
rest kneeled, desiring her grace that all might be forgotten,
and so departed, she being fast locked up again.”<a name="FNanchor_499_499"
id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of these bold words, so little was
Elizabeth resigned to a life of captivity that she never ceased
besieging her friends with letters, petitions that they would
obtain her release, and assurances of her innocence.<a name="FNanchor_500_500"

<p>“A sevennight after,” continues Foxe, “the queen sent
for her grace at ten of the clock in the night, to speak with
her: for she had not seen her in two years before. Yet for
all that, she was amazed at the so sudden sending for, thinking
it had been worse for her than afterwards it proved, and
desired her gentlemen and gentlewomen to pray for her,
for that she could not tell whether ever she should see them
again or no. At which time, coming in, Sir Henry Benifield
[Bedingfeld] with mistress Clarencius,<a name="FNanchor_501_501"
id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
her grace was brought
into the garden unto a stair’s foot that went to the queen’s
lodging, her grace’s gentlewomen waiting upon her, her
gentleman-usher, and her grooms going before with torches;
where her gentleman and gentlewomen being commanded to
stay all, saving one woman, Mistress Clarencius conducted
her to the queen’s bedchamber, where her majesty was. At
the sight of whom, her grace kneeled down, and desired God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
to preserve her majesty, not mistrusting but that she should
try herself as true a subject towards her majesty as ever did
any; and desired her majesty even so to judge of her; and
said that she should not find her to the contrary, whatsoever
report otherwise had gone of her. To whom the queen
answered, ‘You will not confess your offence, but stand stoutly
in your truth. I pray God it may so fall out.’ ‘If it doth
not,’ quoth the lady Elizabeth, ‘I request neither favour nor
pardon at your majesty’s hands.’ ‘Well,’ said the queen, ‘you
stiffly still persevere in your truth. Belike you will not confess
but that you have been wrongfully punished.’ ‘I must not
say so, if it please your Majesty, to you.’ ‘Why then,’ said
the queen, ‘belike you will to others.’ ‘No, if it please your
majesty,’ quoth she. ‘I have borne the burden, and must
bear it. I humbly beseech your majesty to have a good
opinion of me, and to think me to be your true subject, not
only from the beginning hitherto, but for ever, as long as life
lasteth.’ And so they departed, with very few comfortable
words of the queen in English: but what she said in Spanish,
God knoweth. It is thought that King Philip was there,
behind a cloth, and not seen, and that he showed himself
a very friend in that matter.”<a name="FNanchor_502_502"
id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<p>A week later, Sir Henry Bedingfeld’s task was done, and
Elizabeth was free.</p>

<p>Courtenay had been already released from his captivity at
Fotheringhay Castle, and had received advice from the King
and Queen, equivalent to a command, to travel for the improvement
of his mind. He went first to Brussels, from which
place the English ambassador wrote to Sir William Petre:—</p>

<p>“Last Sunday, the Earl of Devon was conducted to the
Emperor by the Duke of Alva. Masone was not present
but by report of the Duke and Chamberlain, whom the Earl
has requested to be his interpreter if necessary, he demeaned
himself very well, declaring, among other things, how much
he was indebted to King Philip for helping him, through the
Queen’s favour out of custody, and also for procuring him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
leave to see the world, whereby he might attain to such
knowledge, as displeasant fortune had caused him hitherto to
lack: for which reason, he had come to offer his services to
the Emperor, the renown of whose court was so great. His
Majesty embraced his offer most willingly, minding from
time to time, to show him such signs of his favour, as the
Earl should have no cause to forthink his journey hither. To
this he said he was moved, not merely by the King’s and
Queen’s recommendation, but for the sake of the Earl’s father,
whose noble virtues were not unknown to him.”<a name="FNanchor_503_503"
id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>Courtenay afterwards went to Italy, where he died in
1556.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, elaborate preparations had been made for
the advent of Mary’s passionately longed for child. Public
prayers were offered for the Queen’s safety, and Parliament
had petitioned Philip that “if it should happen to the queen
otherwise than well, in the time of her travail, he would take
upon himself the government of the realm during the minority
of her majesty’s issue, with the rule, order, education and
government of the said issue”.<a name="FNanchor_504_504"
id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
In the Royal Library in Paris
is a letter addressed to the Queen of Navarre, and describing
an interview with Philip and Mary, at which the latter informed
the writer, that the first desire of her heart was to
have a son. Letters were written as the expected time
approached, to announce the joyful intelligence of the birth
of a child, blank spaces being left for the date and the sex
to be filled in afterwards. But the time wore on and passed,
and it was at last clear that what had been mistaken for
the promise of motherhood, was but the beginning of a fatal
disease. Mary clung to the hope long after her physicians
had assured her that she would never give birth to a child,
and most of those around her flattered the hope, while they
pitied the delusion. One of her women was however more
sincere and a contemporary document relates, “How Mrs.
Clarentius and divers others, as parasites about her, assured
her to be with child, insomuch as the Queen was fully so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
persuaded herself, being right desirous thereof, if God had
been so pleased, that it might have been a comfort to all
Catholic posterity, as she declared by her oration in the
Guild Hall at London, at the rising of Wyatt, which was so
worthy a speech made by her there, touching the cause of her
marriage and why, that it made them that were there, though
of contrary religion, to relent into tears, and hardly could she
suffer any that would not say as she said, touching her being
with child. Mrs. Frideswide Strelley, a good honourable
woman of hers would not yield to her desire, and never told
her an untruth....”<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505"
class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>The writer then describes that “when the rockers and
cradle, and all such things were provided for the Queen’s
delivery, that her time should be nigh, as it was supposed,
and those parasites had had all the spoil of such things
amongst them, and no such matter in the end ... then
when the uttermost time was come, and the Queen thus
deluded, she sent for Sterly (<i>sic</i>) her woman again, to whom
she said, ‘Ah, Strelly, Strelly, I see they be all flatterers,
and none true to me but thou,’ and then was she more in
favour than ever she was before”.</p>

<p>As the hope of an heir was gradually abandoned, all other
reasons for congratulation appeared also to fade away. De
Noailles’ intrigues had prepared a fresh harvest of discontent,
and with Elizabeth’s release, the turbulence of the Londoners
assumed a more insolent character than ever. Hideous lampoons
were circulated, bearing upon the Queen’s supposed condition,
and to increase her agony of mind, Philip showed signs
of a sickening conviction of the uselessness of his sacrifice.</p>

<p>A little book of prayers, once belonging to Queen Mary is
to be seen at the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_506_506"
id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
Its leaves are worn and
thumbed, and it opens of itself at a blurred and tear-stained
page, on which is a petition for the unity of the Catholic
Church, and another for the safe delivery of a woman with
child. These oft-conned prayers afford us a glimpse into the
Queen’s heart, which not all the despatches of ambassadors
are able to give.</p>

Hume, whose history of Mary’s reign repeats the prejudices of Foxe and
others with unwarrantable additions of his own, says, among a tissue of other
inaccuracies, that the marriage took place at Westminster. Murray’s reprint

Underhill, although belonging to the so-called gospellers, and having been
arrested while Mary was in Suffolk, for a ballad which he had written against
Papists, was released a few days after her arrival in London. He always
remained a Protestant, but was so conspicuously loyal to the Queen that he
was never molested for religion during her reign.</p></div>

the grievance was, as the chronicler expressly states, the fact of its being represented
in Henry’s hands, instead of in Mary’s.</p></div>

Martin Hume, <i>The Great Lord Burghly</i>, p. 55. Although Cecil never
held any office under Mary, in consequence of the manner in which he had
distinguished himself in the first rebellion, he sometimes appeared at court,
was rich and influential, and spent most of his time in luxurious ease at his
house at Wimbledon. He not only professed himself a Catholic, but according
to Parsons in his <i>Three Conversions of England</i>, common report attributed
his safety during Mary’s reign to the diligence with which he manipulated a
monstrous pair of beads every morning in Wimbledon Church. The first entry
in the Easter book of Wimbledon Parish in 1556 is: “My Master Sir Wilyam
Cecell and my lady Myldred his wyff,” denoting that they had made their
Easter, <i>i.e.</i>, had confessed and received the Sacrament of the altar.</p></div>

Miss Strickland is wrong in supposing that she was at court in December
1554, returning afterwards to Woodstock. Renard, de Noailles, Foxe, Holinshed,
Stow and others only mention her appearance there on her release in

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is doubtful, even had her hopes of an heir not proved vain,
whether Mary would have been able to control the revolutionary
movement that had now spread from London into
various parts of the country. She had formed an alliance
with the most powerful nation in Europe, she had reconciled
her kingdom to the one stable institution in Christendom,
she had worked incessantly to promote peace between the
Emperor and the French King, she had earnestly desired
peace in her time; and there was no peace.<a name="FNanchor_507_507"
id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a></p>

<p>The enthusiasm with which her advent had been hailed
had entirely subsided, except among the poor, in country
towns and villages, who loved her to the last, and with whom
she came in personal contact, in the most informal manner,
distributing alms, counsel and words of kindness and sympathy.
Many of her autograph letters in the Cotton Library
testify to the fidelity with which she remembered, through
life, the claims of her dependants, although she had scanty
means wherewith to reward them. The great royal progresses
throughout the country, for which Henry VIII. had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
had so marked a predilection, were often a heavy tax upon
the country people. In the time of hay-making or harvesting
it was a serious inconvenience to them to be pressed into the
royal service, and to have their horses and waggons seized for
the transport of household stuff and provisions for the court.
As often as not, they received little or no compensation, while
their beasts were so fatigued with the additional labour, that
a further loss of time was entailed, before they could use them
again. Mary seldom went in progress, and when she did,
was careful not to trouble and vex the country people, at
times when their well-being for the whole year depended on
their industry. If she discovered that her Comptroller had
not acted fairly by them, she was extremely indignant, and
would not rest till she saw the poor folk righted.</p>

<p>She visited them in their own homes, accompanied by two
or three of her ladies, would sit down familiarly among them,
and inquire into their manner of living, talking kindly to
them, while the poor man ate his supper after his day’s work
in the fields, little thinking that he was confiding his troubles
to the Queen, for Mary would have no special ceremony paid
to her by her suite, in order not to embarrass or confuse him.<a name="FNanchor_508_508"
id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
The help she afforded was always substantial and well advised.
If her poor neighbours were overburdened with children, she
did not content herself with dispensing alms, but took care to
advise them to live thriftily, bring up their boys and girls in the
fear of God, and sometimes apprenticed these to an honest
trade, so that they might be able to earn their living and
better their condition. “This she did,” writes the biographer
of the Duchess of Feria, “in a poor carpenter’s house, and the
house of the widow of a husbandman. And in this sort did
she pass some hours with the poor neighbours, with much
plainness and affability; they supposing them all to be Queen’s
maids, for there seemed no difference. And if any complaints
were made, she commended the remembrance very particularly
to Jane Dormer.”<a name="FNanchor_509_509"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>No religious or political agitators had as yet disturbed the
loyalty of these simple peasants; but in London, pasquinades
directed against the Queen had become of constant occurrence.
Offensive and scurrilous language was the order of the day.
A boy named Featherstone was made to personate Edward
VI. in order to dispute her right. Treasonable books, such
as John Knox’s <i>Blast against the Monstrous Regiment of
Women</i>, Goodman’s <i>Superior Magistrate</i>, in which Wyatt was
invoked as a martyr, Poynet’s treatise on <i>Politic Power</i>, were
busily circulated, and roused the spirit of revolt in the minds
of thousands of hitherto peaceable citizens. The seditious
availed themselves boldly of the shibboleth liberty of conscience
and of the 270 persons estimated by Foxe, as having
suffered for religion during this reign, many were, quite apart
from their religious opinions, traitors, assassins and perjurers.
The Venetian ambassador says, in a letter to the Doge, dated
13th May 1555:<a name="FNanchor_510_510"
id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355"
id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> “Certain knaves in this country endeavour
daily to disturb the peace and quiet, and present state of
the kingdom, so as if possible to induce some novelty and
insurrection, there having been publicly circulated of late
throughout the city, a <i>Dialogue</i> written and printed in
English, full of seditious and scandalous things against the
religion and government, as also against the Council, the
Parliament, and chiefly against their Majesties’ persons; and
although all diligence has been used for the discovery of the
authors, no light on the subject has yet been obtained, save
that an Italian has been put in the Tower, he being a master
for teaching the Italian tongue to Milady Elizabeth, some
suspicion having been apparently entertained of him. The
edition of the <i>Dialogue</i> was so copious, that a thousand copies
have been taken to the Lord Mayor, who by order of their
Majesties, commanded all those who had any of them to bring
them to him under heavy penalties.”</p>

<p>A royal proclamation was then issued, to the effect that
all books, both Latin and English, concerning “any heretical,
erroneous or slanderous doctrines, might be destroyed and
burnt throughout the realm,” as also against conveying into
the kingdom any books, writings or works by writers thereinafter
named. All the names of the principal reformers follow,
as also that of Erasmus, who was at that time looked upon
with distrust. The Book of Common Prayer “set forth by
the authority of Parliament” in the reign of Edward VI. was
to be delivered up within the space of fifteen days, to be burned
or otherwise disposed of.<a name="FNanchor_511_511"
id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>But these measures only increased the fanaticism. William
Thomas, who had been clerk of the Council under Edward, and
was a disciple of the preacher Goodman, plotted to murder
the Queen, “for which he was sent to the Tower, and afterwards
executed, at which time he said he died for his country”.<a name="FNanchor_512_512"
id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>
Wriothesley and Machyn both chronicle a murderous attack
made on a priest at the altar rails. The former says: “The
4 day of April (1555) being Easter Day was a lewd fact done
in the church of St. Margaret, Westminster. Sir John Sleuther,
priest, ministering the sacrament to the parishioners, and holding
the chalice in his left hand, one William Branch, <i>alias</i>
called Flower, in a serving-man’s coat, suddenly drew a wood
knife, and struck the priest on the head, that the blood ran
down, and fell both on the chalice and on the consecrated
bread. The said person was apprehended, and committed
to the Gatehouse in Westminster.” Machyn adds that the
ruffian assaulted the priest, after saying that “by the idolatory
which he committed, he deceived the crowds of souls there
assembled, with other disgusting language, and gave him two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
deep wounds, one in the hand, the other in the head, that he
fell as if dead, causing such an uproar and tumult, in part from
the shrieks of the women, and the multitude of persons present,
who pursued the man as if to put him to death. It was thought
for a moment that the English had risen for the purpose of
massacring the Spaniards, and all the other foreigners who
lived in that quarter. The man was seized, and burnt for the
assault, on the 24th April following, outside St. Margaret’s
churchyard.”<a name="FNanchor_513_513"
id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>This outrage was a bold advance on the part of the revolutionists,
who the previous year had contented themselves with
derisively hanging a cat on the gallows in Cheapside, dressed
in full pontificals.</p>

<p>Holinshed, Stow and Strype all tell a story of a fraud,
perpetrated by the Queen’s enemies. Strange sounds were
heard to issue from a house in Aldersgate Street, interspersed
with obscure words, perfectly incomprehensible, until they were
interpreted by certain persons who were in the secret. These
told the crowds assembled in front of the house, that what they
heard was the voice of the Holy Ghost, warning a wicked and
perverse generation. It inveighed, they said, against the
Queen’s marriage, and the impiety of the Mass; and the
citizens were threatened with war, famine, pestilence and
earthquakes. The tumult became so great, that the magistrates
ordered the front wall of the house to be demolished,
when a young woman, named Elizabeth Crofts, crept out of a
hiding place, and confessed that she had been hired to commit
the fraud. She was put in the pillory, but afterwards pardoned
and sent home.<a name="FNanchor_514_514"
id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>The way in which religion was purposely confused with
political grievances, real or supposed, was the cause of more
than half the difficulty. The Council were still for prosecuting
the criminals for heresy, the Emperor for ever maintained
that they should be tried for treason.</p>

<p>The Venetian ambassador notifies a slight insurrection in
Essex, whereupon Bonner received an order from the Privy
Council to send “certain discreet and learned preachers to
reduce the people who hath been of late seduced by sundry
lewd persons named ministers there”.<a name="FNanchor_515_515"
id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
The state of affairs is
thus seen to have entered into a vicious circle. The lawlessness
of the sectaries prompted severe reprisals, and the punishments
inflicted did but aggravate the evil instead of suppressing it.
“I have never,” said Renard, “seen the people so disturbed
and discontented as now.” For six months, he had not ceased
urging that Elizabeth, who was, he considered, the cause of all
the troubles, should be sent abroad.</p>

<p>The opinion was at that time general, that capital punishment
might be inflicted in religious matters. Catholics and
Reformers were alike agreed on this subject, differing only as
to their definition of heresy. Catholics regarded it as a revolt
from the teaching of a divinely appointed Church; each individual
Reformer submitted it to the test of his own private
judgment. Calvin burned Servetus for his opinions on the
Blessed Trinity, an act that was not only attended with as
many aggravating circumstances as any death for heresy that
had ever been suffered, but which was almost unanimously
applauded by the Protestants of that time, Melancthon,
Bullinger and Farel all writing to express their approval of
it. Those who objected were called by Beza, “emissaries of
Satan”. Luther, in his reply to Philip of Hesse, distinctly
asserted the right of civil magistrates to punish heresy with
death, a right that was maintained by the Helvetic, Belgic,
Scottish and Saxon confessions. Calvin, Beza and Jurieu all
wrote books to prove the lawfulness of persecution for false
doctrine, each having independent views of what was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
true.<a name="FNanchor_516_516"
id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
Knox in his famous <i>Appellation</i> says: “None provoking
the people to idolatry ought to be exempted from the punishment
of death ... it is not only lawful to punish to the death
such as labour to subvert the true religion, but the magistrates
and people are bound to do so, unless they will provoke the
wrath of God against themselves ... and therefore, my Lords,
to return to you, seeing that God hath armed your hands with
the sword of justice, seeing that His law most straightly
commandeth idolaters and false prophets to be punished with
death, and that you be placed above your subjects, to reign
as fathers over children, and further, seeing that not only I,
but with me many thousand famous, godly and learned persons
accuse your bishops, and the whole rabble of the Papistical
clergy, of idolatry, of murder and of blasphemy against God
committed, it appertaineth to your honours to be vigilant
and careful in so weighty a matter. The question is not of
earthly substance, but of the glory of God and of the salvation
of yourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_517_517"
id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>In Edward’s reign, Cranmer not only pronounced sentence
on Joan Bocher, for holding that Christ was not incarnate of
the Blessed Virgin Mary, but informed the King, in delivering
her over to the civil power, that she was to be “deservedly
punished,” which meant that she was to be burned.<a name="FNanchor_518_518"
id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> He also
pronounced sentence on van Parris, and gave the same
recommendation, and handed over several Anabaptists to be
burned at Smithfield. In his new code of ecclesiastical discipline,
Cranmer classed belief in Transubstantiation, in Papal
supremacy, and in the denial of justification by faith alone, as
heresy. But Edward died before this code had obtained the
sanction of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_519_519"
id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>Both in England and Scotland, the Reformation signalised
itself by a law, making it penal for any priest to say Mass,
for any worshipper to hear it, under pain of death for the one,
of confiscation of his goods, heavy fines, exile, and finally
death for the other. “One Mass,” exclaimed Knox, “is more
fearful to me than if ten thousand armed enemies were landed
in any part of the realm!” In 1572, the two Houses of Convocation
implored Elizabeth to put Mary Queen of Scots to
death, giving as one reason, that she had endeavoured to
seduce God’s people to idolatry, and that according to the
Old Testament, all who did so should be put to death.<a name="FNanchor_520_520"
id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> “There
was an express order that no pity should be shown them.” But
not only did the Reformers adopt the principle, that heresy,
such as each understood it to be, was punishable by death,
the newly established Protestant Governments also claimed
the right to define heresy, as well as to punish it. Mr. Lecky
states no more than bare facts, when he says that, “In
Scotland during nearly the whole period that the Stuarts
were on the throne of England, a persecution, rivalling in
atrocity almost any on record, was directed by the English
Government, at the instigation of the Scotch bishops, and
with the approval of the English Church, against all who
repudiated episcopacy. If a conventicle was held in a house,
the preacher was liable to be put to death. If it was held
in the open air, both minister and people incurred the same
fate. The Presbyterians were hunted like criminals over
the mountains. Their ears were torn from the roots.
They were branded with hot irons. Their fingers were
wrenched asunder by the thumbkins. The bones of their
legs were shattered in the boots. Women were scourged
publicly through the streets. Multitudes were transported
to Barbadoes, infuriated soldiers were let loose upon them
and encouraged to exercise all their ingenuity in torturing
them.”<a name="FNanchor_521_521"
id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<p>It is thus clear, that if the sixteenth century, and the ages
preceding it were not acquainted with our modern ideas of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
religious toleration, neither indeed were the seventeenth and
the beginning of the eighteenth centuries. As late as 1679,
an Irish Franciscan was executed for his priesthood at
Ruthin, being hanged, cut down while yet alive, drawn and
quartered;<a name="FNanchor_522_522"
id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>
and in 1729 died in Hurst Castle another Franciscan,
Father Paul Atkinson, who had been apprehended
and condemned to perpetual imprisonment for the same
crime.<a name="FNanchor_523_523"
id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>On the Catholic side, two authorities may be quoted in
favour of the punishment of heresy as a crime; and the
standpoint from which it was so regarded may be briefly
stated thus. Before the Reformation, the Catholic Church
was universally recognised as the sole depositary of revealed
truth. To the mediæval mind, he who was convicted of
spreading doctrine contrary to the teaching of this divine
institution was worse than a fratricide, since by poisoning
the wells of truth, he murdered not his brother’s perishable
body, but his immortal soul, and was, therefore, deserving of
death. It is difficult for us, whose minds are necessarily imbued
with modern ideas, to realise the mode of thought concerning
novelties of doctrine which agitated all the countries of Europe
in the middle ages, and which still agitated them when so
much that was purely mediæval had passed away. Nor can we
estimate to the full the depth of those profound convictions, on
the subject of revealed religion, which called forth the ecclesiastical
and civil enactments, framed to prevent any tampering
with dogma. We have in our days no practical experience
of a system <i>universally</i> admitted and recognised to be the
sole depositary of revealed truth, such as the Catholic Church
was acknowledged to be, before the rise and growth of Protestantism.
Accustomed to the presence of religious speculation,
doubt, and unbelief around us, or at least to the existence
of varying creeds, we are familiar with the notion that every
man may weigh and consider the credibility of each doctrine
proposed to him, and that he is at liberty to accept or reject
it, to halve or to double it, according to the promptings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
his own individual judgment. Religious truth has come to
be considered so much a personal affair, that Roman Catholics
are perhaps alone in looking upon it as a divine deposit, a
purely objective matter, independent of what this or that man
may think, and to be accepted undoubtingly by the faithful.
And this was precisely the state of the pre-Reformation mind.
But the opinion is sometimes expressed in our own day, that
were the Catholic Church again powerful, as in the middle ages,
we should see a recurrence of persecution as determined as any
that marked with horror the former annals of our country.
The notion is as absurd as it would be to imagine that if
the Puritans were again masters, they would bring back the
thumbkin, the boots, the rack and the sword, in order to
enforce the uselessness of good works. No organised persecution
could ever be possible where the general trend of ideas
was not in its favour. Our thicker-skinned ancestors had
far less sympathy with bodily suffering, and a much lower
appreciation of the value of human life than ourselves. In
an age when coiners and forgers were punished with death,
it would have seemed incongruous that apostates and heretics
should fare more softly.<a name="FNanchor_524_524"
id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>
The Reformers, who rejected nearly
every tenet held by the universal Church, were almost all
agreed to retain the punishment by which those tenets had
been vindicated. St. Thomas Aquinas says:—</p>

<p>“The crime of heresy must be considered first in itself
and then in its connexion with the Church. If we consider
the crime in itself, heretics deserve not only to be cut off from
the Church by excommunication, but to be cut off from the
world by death. They are more guilty than those who coin
false money, for it is more grave to corrupt the faith which is
the life of the soul, than to falsify coins, by which that of the
body is supported; and thus they are justly put to death like
other malefactors. Considered in connexion with the Church,
it is clear that she, ever merciful and desirous of obtaining the
conversion of those who are in error, does not at once condemn
the heretic, but exhorts him to repentance, according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
the teaching of the apostle. It is only when he shows himself
obstinate, and if she despairs of his salvation, that she cuts
him off from herself, and abandons him to the secular arm
that he may be put to death.”<a name="FNanchor_525_525"
id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>The fourth Lateran Council decreed, that no beneficed
clerk, or any clerk in holy orders, might take any part, even
the most mechanical and subordinate, in the judicial doing to
death of a criminal.<a name="FNanchor_526_526"
id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>
Heresy was, however, looked upon as
an ecclesiastical as well as a civil offence, the delinquent first
committing a grave crime against God, by denying and
attacking the truths which He had revealed, so that by his
example he led other men astray. Secondly, by so doing he
raised tumults, and endangered the peace of the commonwealth.
He was, therefore, tried in the ecclesiastical courts,
and if found guilty and obdurate, was handed over to the
State for punishment. “Cognisance of heresies, errors and
Lollardies appertaineth to the judge of holy Church.”<a name="FNanchor_527_527"
id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>Long before the rise of Lollardy, burning at the stake was
the recognised punishment for heresy, just as decapitation
and hanging were the penalty for the crimes of treason and
murder. An obstinate Albigensian was burned in London
in 1210, and in 1222 a deacon suffered death at Oxford, for
turning Jew, and marrying a Jewess.<a name="FNanchor_528_528"
id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
The first Act of Parliament
against heresy was passed in the reign of Henry IV.
(1401) and dealt with the suppression of Lollardy. Nevertheless,
the placing of the new law on the statute book was not
followed by any great increase in the number of punishments,
and there were more burnings in the reign of Henry VIII.
than in the whole of the previous century.</p>

<p>The second authority on the Catholic side on the subject
of the punishment of heresy is an Englishman, Sir Thomas
More, who says:—</p>

<p>“As touching heretics, I hate that vice of theirs, and not
their persons, and very fain would I that the one were
destroyed and the other saved. And that I have toward no
man any other mind than this—how loudly soever these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
blessed new brethren and professors and preachers of heresy
belie me—if all the favour and pity that I have used among
them to their amendment were known, it would, I warrant
you well and plain appear; whereof, if it were requisite, I
could bring forth witnesses more than men would ween.
Howbeit, because it were neither right nor honesty, that any
man should look for more than he deserveth, I will that all
the world wit it on the other side, that whoso be so deeply
grounded in malice, to the harm of his own soul, and other
men’s too, and so set upon the sowing of seditious heresies,
that no good means that men may use unto him can pull
that malicious folly out of his poisoned, proud, obstinate
heart, I would rather be content that he were gone in time,
than overlong to tarry to the destruction of other.”<a name="FNanchor_529_529"
id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>Mary’s Parliament of 1554, which abolished her title of
Supreme Head of the Church of England, threw out the bill
for reviving the Act of 1401 against heresy, chiefly on Paget’s
motion, but it was brought in again in the following January,
and in four days it had passed through both Houses without
opposition.</p>

<p>It was felt that a breakwater had become imperatively
necessary to stop the inflowing tide of sedition. Ross, a
reformed preacher, prayed openly, that God would “either
convert the heart of the Queen, or take her out of this
world”. It was then made treason to pray in public for the
Queen’s death. But those who had been already committed
for this offence might recover their liberty, by making humble
protestation and promise of amendment.</p>

<p>While the Council were debating on the manner in which
the revived Act should be enforced, the Queen sent them a
message, written in her own hand, in which, after expressing
her wishes with regard to several points of ecclesiastical discipline,
she said:—</p>

<p>“Touching punishment of heretics, me thinketh it ought
to be done without rashness, not leaving in the meanwhile to
do justice to such as by learning would seem to deceive the
simple: and the rest so to be used, that the people might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
well perceive them not to be condemned without just occasion,
whereby they shall both understand the truth, and beware to
do the like: and especially within London, I would wish none
to be burnt without some of the Council’s presence, and both
there and everywhere good sermons at the same”.<a name="FNanchor_530_530"
id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<p>From the fact that the Queen advocated sermons at the
stake it has been inferred that Philip exercised considerable
influence on the persecution, as it was the Spanish custom
for preachments to be held at the <i>autos da fe</i> of heretics.
But indeed the custom was quite as much an English as it
was a Spanish one. At the burning of Friar Forest, for refusing
to acknowledge Henry’s ecclesiastical supremacy, Hugh
Latimer preached for three hours against the Papal claims,
when the martyr fixing his eyes on him said: “Seven years
back thou durst not have made such a sermon for thy life!”</p>

<p>It is probable, that neither Philip nor Mary was keen to
punish as heresy, the rebellious spirit manifested by the
religionists. The persecution was a movement of expediency,
set on foot by the Council, as a means of coping with the disturbances.
The Emperor and Renard were distinctly opposed
to it, and now the Spanish friar, Alfonso de Castro, Philip’s
confessor, in preaching before the court, strenuously denounced
the measure, which he would scarcely have ventured
to do in so public a manner, if it had been ardently desired
by the King and Queen. Moreover, the most enlightened
among the English clergy, including the Bishop of London,
who had at first been in favour of it, though agreeing in the
general principle, that erroneous thinking led to erroneous
acting, were against its adoption at this juncture. But Parliament
willed it, and “it was not therefore,” says an authority
on English law, “the policy of the church but of the crown,
and not merely of the crown but of the state. It was the act
of the crown with the authority of Parliament, and the assent
of the council.”<a name="FNanchor_531_531"
id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>The same writer, accentuating this opinion, which appears
incontrovertible, says in another place:—</p>

<p>“With reference to this unhappy persecution, it appears
important to observe, that it was not the will of the church but
of the state, that it was the result not of the religious bigotry
of ecclesiastics, but of state policy, and there is reason to
believe not a little, of the worst and vilest state craft. It did
not commence until after the marriage with the Spanish King,
nor until after the lapse of two years after the restoration of
the ancient religion, and then it was not only not instigated
but it was rather discouraged by the prelates; and though it
was no doubt authorized by the sovereign, it was at the
advice of her council, composed chiefly of laymen. The
Cardinal Legate opposed it, the King’s confessor preached
against it, the prelates acted only upon compulsion, and there
is reason to believe from the Queen’s reply to the representation
of the council, that she rather yielded to their advice,
and desired the execution of the measure not only to be
moderated, but to be directed rather against popular
agitators, than against mere private holders of heretical
opinions.”<a name="FNanchor_532_532"
id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>Our principal data for the history of this persecution are
derived from John Foxe’s <i>Acts and Monuments</i>, and the
martyrologist’s spirit of animosity, wilful misrepresentation
and neglect to rectify obvious errors, have exposed his book
to everlasting reproach. On the death of his last descendant,
the greater number of his manuscripts were either given to
Strype, or allowed to remain in Strype’s hands till his death in
1737, when many of them were purchased for the Harleian
Collection, now in the British Museum. A few found their
way into the Lansdowne Library. They include amongst a
mass of heterogeneous documents of the most unequal value
and interest—such as the depositions of some who were really
present at the different executions for religion in the reign of
Queen Mary, minutes of the examination of prisoners, apparently
written on the spot, fantastic stories of his favourite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
theory concerning the judgments of God, on those who
persecuted the followers of the reformed doctrines, and the
thrilling legend of Pope Joan—several statements sent to
Foxe for the purpose of correcting portions of his work, but
of which he never made any use. Nearly, if not quite all the
material for that part of the <i>Acts and Monuments</i>, which
deals with the reign of Mary, was collected by others for Foxe
and Grindal, during their absence from England. Grindal
handed over to Foxe the accounts of the various prosecutions
for heresy sent to him by his correspondents at home, taking
care, however, at the same time, to warn the martyrologist
against placing too much confidence in them, he himself
suspending his judgment, “till more satisfactory evidence
came from good hands”. He advised him for the present,
only to print separately the acts of particular persons, of
whom they had authentic accounts, and to wait for a larger
and completer history, until they had reliable information of
the whole persecution.<a name="FNanchor_533_533"
id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
But the careful investigation which
Grindal recommended did not fall in with the particular genius
and uncritical methods of Foxe, who, perhaps on account of
his necessitous condition, worked with a will, on the unsifted
tales and reports, as they came to hand, so that the book in
its Latin form was completed, almost to the end of Mary’s
reign, and was published at Basle, before his return to England
in 1559. He afterwards made an English translation of the
work, but without seeing fit to revise his material, and it was
given to the public under the title of <i>Acts and Monuments</i>.
It was at once popularly styled the <i>Book of Martyrs</i>.</p>

<p>When attacked by Alan Cope (Nicholas Harpsfield) for
his inaccuracies, Foxe replied, “I hear what you will say; I
should have taken more leisure, and done it better. I grant
and confess my fault; such is my vice. I cannot sit all the
day (M. Cope) fining and mincing my letters, and combing
my head, and smoothing myself all the day at the glass of
Cicero. Yet notwithstanding doing what I can, and doing
my good will, methinks I should not be reprehended.”<a name="FNanchor_534_534"
id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> Parsons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
in his <i>Three Conversions of England</i><a name="FNanchor_535_535"
id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> makes “a note of
more than a hundred and twenty lies uttered by John Foxe in
less than three leaves of his <i>Acts and Monuments</i>,” and he
proceeds to point them out, beginning with the lie concerning
John Marbeck, and some others, whom he counts among the
martyrs, although they were never burned at all. John
Marbeck was an eminent musician and a controversial writer
on the Protestant side. As in consequence of Parsons’
remark, Foxe acknowledged the error, in his second edition,
he may be held excused thus far; but his delinquencies in
this respect were not infrequent, and gave rise to the saying
that “Many who were burnt in the reign of Queen Mary
drank sack in the days of Queen Elizabeth”.<a name="FNanchor_536_536"
id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>Two similar mistakes which he was in a position to correct
and did not, relate to the supposed death by the vengeance of
God, of Henry Morgan, Bishop of St. David’s, and of one
Grimwood, another “notorious Papist”.</p>

<p>Anthony à Wood, the famous antiquary and historian,
who wrote his <i>History of the Antiquities of Oxford</i> about a
hundred years after Foxe had become celebrated as a
martyrologist, and who in his youth spoke with people who
remembered the days of persecution in the reign of Mary,
says that “Henry Morgan was esteemed a most admirable
civilian and canonist; he was for several years the constant
Moderator of all those that performed exercise for their
degrees in the civil law in the school or schools, hall and
church pertaining to that faculty, situated also in the same
parish.... He was elected Bishop of St. David’s upon the
deprivation of Robert Ferrar.... In that see he sate till after
Queen Elizabeth came to the Crown, and then being deprived
... retired among his friends, and died a devoted son
to the Church of Rome, on the 23 of December following
(1559) of whose death, hear I pray what John Fox saith
in this manner: <i>Morgan, Bishop of St. David’s who sate upon
the condemnation of the blessed Martyr Bishop Ferrar, and
unjustly usurped his room, was not long after stricken by God’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
hand, after such a strange sort, that his meat would not go
down, but rise and pick up again, sometimes at his mouth,
sometimes blown out of his nose, most horribly to behold, and so
he continued till his death</i>. Thus Fox followed by Thomas
Beard, in his <i>Theatre of God’s Judgments</i>. But where or when
his death happened they tell us not, nor any author hitherto,
only when. Now therefore be pleased to know, that the said
Bishop Morgan, retiring after his deprivation to and near
Oxon, where he had several relations and acquaintance
living, particularly the Owens of Godstow in the parish of
Wolvercote, near the said city, did spend the little remainder
of his life in great devotion at Godstow, but that he died
in the condition which Fox mentions, there is no tradition
among the inhabitants of Wolvercote. True it is that I
have heard some discourse many years ago from some of the
ancients of that place, that a certain Bishop did live for some
time, and exercised his charity and religious counsel among
them, and there died, but I could never learn anything of
them of the manner of his death, which being very miserable
as John Fox saith, methinks that they should have a tradition
of it, as well as of the man himself, but I say there is now
none, nor was there any thirty years ago, among the most
aged persons then living at that place, and therefore whether
there be anything of truth in it may be justly doubted; and
especially for this reason, that in the very same chapter and
leaf containing the severe punishment upon persecutors of
God’s People, he hath committed a most egregious falsity
in reporting that one Grimwood, of Higham in Suffolk, died
in a miserable manner, for swearing and bearing false witness
against one John Cooper, a carpenter of Watsam in the same
county; for which he lost his life. The miserable death of
the said Grimwood was as John Fox saith thus, that <i>when he
was in his labour, staking up a gosse of corn, having his health,
and fearing no peril, suddenly his bowels fell out of his body,
and immediately most miserably he died</i>. Now it so fell out
that in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, one Prick became
parson of the parish where the said Grimwood dwelt, and
preaching against perjury, being not acquainted with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
parishioners, cited the said story of Fox, and it happening
that Grimwood being alive, and in the said church, he brought
an action upon the case against the parson, but Judge
Anderson, who sate at the assizes, in the county of Suffolk
did adjudge it not maintainable, because it was not spoken
maliciously.”<a name="FNanchor_537_537"
id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>That the case was not maintained on this ground, as
against the parson, was no doubt fair and just, but Foxe
cannot himself be as reasonably acquitted, for although he
went into Suffolk to investigate the matter, he never made
any alteration in his story, which has appeared in all the
subsequent editions of his work.</p>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of the present volume to
indicate all the misstatements and distorted facts of which
he was guilty, some being, no doubt, as much the result of
the far too ambitious scheme of his undertaking, as of his
preconceived malice.</p>

<p>Thirty years after the death of Sir Thomas More, the
martyrologist proceeded to collect all the traditional gossip
afloat concerning the Chancellor’s treatment of certain individuals
accused of heresy; and he gravely introduces it into
his <i>Acts and Monuments</i> as historical fact. All these fables
had been refuted by More himself, in his famous <i>Apology</i>,
made at a time when, although he stood alone, defenceless
and obnoxious, none were bold enough to challenge his truth.</p>

<p>We shall, later on, have occasion incidentally to notice
cases of Foxe’s glaring inaccuracy; suffice it here to mention
one instance, which is fairly representative of his manner.
He chronicles the martyrdom at Newent, on the 25th September
1556, of “Jhon Horne and a woman”. On investigation
it transpires, that the story is nothing more than an amplification
of the burning of Edward Horne, who suffered on the
25th September 1558, and that no woman suffered at either
of these times. This confusion was first notified by John
Deighton, a friendly critic of the <i>Acts and Monuments</i>, clearly
not disposed to magnify its imperfections.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>
<p>It is one of the many anomalies which confront the student
of sixteenth century methods, that the <i>Book of Martyrs</i> being
what it is, a mass of unsorted fact and fiction, carelessly
thrown together, often proved untrustworthy, rarely corrected,
and at the best uncritical, one-sided and violent, should not
merely have leapt into the foremost rank of contemporary
literature, but should have attained in the popular estimation
the level of the Bible itself. Foxe had been penniless when
he returned to England in 1559, but the success of his book,
first published in 1563, made his fortune. The Catholics called
it derisively <i>Foxe’s Golden Legend</i>. In 1570, a second edition
was printed, in two volumes folio, and Convocation decreed
that the book designated by the canon as <i>Monumenta Martyrum</i>,
should be placed in cathedral churches, and in the
houses of the great ecclesiastical dignitaries. This decree,
although never confirmed by Parliament, was so much in
accordance with the Puritan tone of the whole Church of
England at that time, that even parish churches, far and wide
were furnished with copies of the work, chained side by side
with the Bible. The vestry minutes of St. Michael’s Church,
Cornhill, of the 11th January, 1571-72, ordered “that the booke
of Martyrs of Mr. Foxe, and the paraphrases (of the Gospel)
of Erasmus shalbe bowght for the church, and tyed with
a chain to the Egle bras”. A few years ago, mutilated copies
of the <i>Acts and Monuments</i> might still be seen chained, in
the parish churches of Apethorpe (Northamptonshire), of
Arreton (Isle of Wight), of Chelsea, of Eustone (Oxfordshire),
Kinver (Staffordshire), Lessingham (Norfolk), St. Nicholas
(Newcastle-on-Tyne), Northwold (Norfolk), Stratford-on-Avon,
Waltham, St. Cuthbert (Wells).<a name="FNanchor_538_538"
id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>

<p>No more potent means could have been devised for saturating
the national mind with a hatred of Queen Mary, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
of her religion, than the diffusion of the <i>Book of Martyrs</i>
on this gigantic scale. In a short time, there was scarcely
a parish church in England, that did not possess a copy of
the work, which was at the disposal of all who could read.
Those who were illiterate might frequently be seen standing
in a group round the lectern, while one among them read
aloud from the graphic pages. In many churches, a chapter
was read to the assembled congregations every Sunday evening
along with the Bible, and the clergy constantly made its
stories of martyrdom the subject of their sermons. One of
the indictments against Archbishop Laud, at his trial, was
the fact of his having ordered the book to be withdrawn from
some churches.<a name="FNanchor_539_539"
id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
But the secret of its charm for Puritan
England did not altogether lie in its anti-Marian character,
or in the partisanship of its garbled facts, and fictitious heroisms.
The simplicity of its vigorous English, the picturesque,
though minute circumstances which it detailed, the very
boldness with which it lied, and above all, its appeal to the
newly awakened passion for the private interpretation of
Scripture, endeared it to the children of the new era. Nevertheless,
it was undeniably one of the most powerful engines
in the conspiracy to blacken Mary’s fame, and cast a lurid
light on the few years of her troubled reign. It was not so
much an epoch-making book as the embodiment of a movement,
the effects of which have not yet passed away, and
even the <i>Pilgrim’s Progress</i>, a far more imaginative and strictly
religious work than Foxe’s, did not displace the <i>Acts and
Monuments</i> in the religious life of the nation. The two
together did perhaps more than anything else to wean the
people from the old faith.</p>

<p>But, apart from all misrepresentation, exaggeration, distorted
evidence and positive fiction, there remains the fact
that a considerable number of persons did perish at the stake
in Mary’s reign, although it is as great an historical absurdity
to apply to Mary the epithet “bloody,” as it is to attach that
of “good” to Queen Elizabeth. Mary did but sanction that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
which was not only the common practice throughout Christendom,
but which had been the law of England for more than
150 years, and which continued in force for upwards of a century
after her. Utterly repugnant to modern ideas as is the
thought which made it possible to punish any religious propaganda
with the death of the propagandist, we must admit that
Mary, and those whose business it was to carry out the law, far
from entertaining feelings of vengeance, provided every possible
loophole of escape for those under examination. Moreover,
the accused, even on the showing of Foxe, instead of being
the meek and lamb-like martyrs we have been led to consider
them, persistently flouted their judges, and treated them with
flippant insolence and contempt.</p>

<p>Immediately after the revival of the statute, it was Gardiner’s
unwelcome duty, with thirteen other bishops and a
number of laymen, to sit in a commission of inquiry into the
teaching of four Churchmen, Hooper, the deprived Bishop of
Gloucester; Rogers, Prebendary of St. Paul’s; Saunders,
Rector of Allhallows, and Taylor, Rector of Hadley in Sussex.
This was the only occasion on which Gardiner presided over
a trial for heresy.</p>

<p>Hooper, by far the most distinguished of the four, had had
a singularly chequered career, even for those stirring times.
Perhaps even more than Cranmer, he had come under the
influence of the German reformers. He had entered the
cloister at an early age, and had graduated as a religious at
Oxford, but had returned to secular life, after some fray in
which he was concerned. He fed his mind on the writings
of Zwingli and Bullinger, and identified himself so closely
with their opinions, that on the promulgation of the <i>Six
Articles</i> he was obliged to fly the country. He went to
Zürich, the hot-bed of Calvinism, and there attacked Gardiner’s
book on the Holy Eucharist. On Edward’s accession, he
returned to England, and continued the controversy in a
lecture which he delivered on the 1st September 1549. This
lecture brought him into notice and favour with the Council,
and when Bonner attacked his doctrine in a powerful sermon
preached to a large congregation at St. Paul’s, Hooper retaliated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
by denouncing the Bishop of London.<a name="FNanchor_540_540"
id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> Bonner was
therefore examined as to his belief in the dogma in question,
deprived, and sent to the Tower. But although Hooper was
now made King’s Preacher, he did not allow himself to exult
greatly over his good fortune. “Sharp and dangerous,” said
he, “has been my contest with that bishop; if he be restored
again to his office, I shall be restored to my Father which is
in heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_541_541"
id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
He threw himself with ardour into the war then
raging against altars, vestments, priests and bishops, putting
himself at the head of the Gospellers. None of his contemporaries
surpassed him in forcible language. In 1551 some
altars were still standing in the diocese of Chichester, in spite
of the decree of the Council, that they should be destroyed,
and Masses were still surreptitiously offered at some of them.<a name="FNanchor_542_542"
id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>
“The bishops and priests do damnable and devilish superstition,”
he exclaimed in one of his sermons,<a name="FNanchor_543_543"
id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> “saying Mass,
conjuring the holy water bucket and the like, in the congregation
of God.... Into the sea with all clerks who will not
preach the true doctrine and teach the catechism.” The
Council owed it mainly to Hooper, if their behests were at
last obeyed. “So long as the altars remain, the ignorant
people and evil-persuaded priests will dream of sacrifice,” he
persisted, until even the places where the altars had stood were
whitewashed, so that no vestige of them might remain. In
one of his pungent sermons, he went so far as to condemn
Cranmer’s new Prayer Book, as savouring too much of Popery.
For this he was brought before the Council, but came out of
the debate victorious, and was offered a bishopric which he
refused, saying, “I cannot put on me a surplice and a cope.
I cannot swear by created beings.” Even Edward’s Government
found his eloquence inconvenient, and he was sent to
the Fleet for his intemperate preaching.<a name="FNanchor_544_544"
id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> He was at length
consecrated Bishop of Gloucester, with the usual ceremonies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
but was afterwards allowed to discard the hated vestments of
Episcopacy, “the rags of the harlot of Babylon,” as he described
them. He does not seem to have had any scruple
in holding the bishopric of Worcester <i>in commendam</i>; but
he consistently maintained the greatest simplicity, forbade
the people under his jurisdiction, to stand at the reading of
the Gospel, or to kneel when they received Communion.<a name="FNanchor_545_545"
id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p>

<p>He was indefatigable in striving to enlighten the gross
ignorance of his clergy. “Out of 300, 168 were unable to
repeat the Ten Commandments, 31 knew not where to find
them in the Bible, 40 could not find the Lord’s Prayer in the
Bible, and 31 did not know who framed it.”<a name="FNanchor_546_546"
id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st September 1553, Hooper was again committed
to the Fleet, not apparently on a charge of religion, but for
debts due to the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_547_547"
id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>
While he was in prison, the statute
against Lollardy was again enforced, and he and his three companions
were examined as to their doctrine. They pleaded
conscientious objections to the religion restored by the Queen.
Gardiner allowed them twenty-four hours for reflection, but
on their second refusal to retract, they were excommunicated,
degraded, and handed over to the civil power. Hooper was
sent back to Gloucester, where he suffered at the stake.
Rogers was burned at Smithfield, Saunders at Coventry, and
Taylor at Hadley.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Gardiner was by no means the savage tyrant
Foxe represents him to be. His personal kindness to the
proscribed brethren was amply acknowledged by them. He
furnished Peter Martyr with funds to escape out of England,
shielded Thomas Smith, formerly Secretary to Edward
VI., from persecution, and generously allowed him a yearly
pension of £100 for his support. Of his behaviour to Roger
Ascham, the reformer himself said, “Stephen Gardiner, Bishop
of Winchester, High Chancellor of England, treated me with
the utmost humanity and favour, so that I cannot easily decide
whether Paget was more ready to commend me, or Winchester
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
to protect and benefit me; there were not wanting some, who
on the ground of religion, attempted to stop the flow of his
benevolence towards me, but to no purpose. I owe very much
to the humanity of Winchester, and not only I, but many
others who have experienced his kindness.”<a name="FNanchor_548_548"
id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> One of the
“many others” was John Frith, whom Gardiner did his best
to save.<a name="FNanchor_549_549"
id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>
It was said, that even the Duke of Northumberland
would not have perished, had the Chancellor’s counsels prevailed.</p>

<p>Cranmer, Latimer and Ridley had remained in the Tower,
where at first they had enjoyed considerable freedom, till
March 1554. Ridley dined frequently at the Lieutenant’s
table, and he and Cranmer were allowed the liberty of the
Queen’s garden, Latimer being kept more straitly. But after
Wyatt’s rebellion, the Tower being crowded with prisoners,
the three bishops were put together in one room, and to them
was added Ridley’s chaplain, John Bradford. In the spring
of 1554, they were sent to Oxford, to take part in a theological
discussion on the Mass.</p>

<p>Ridley, the most learned of the three, was born in 1500
and was consequently fifty-four years old at the time of the
disputation. He had adopted the principles of the German
reformers in 1536, and renounced his belief in transubstantiation
in the year of Henry’s death, after which he laboured
strenuously to defend and spread the new doctrines. Cranmer
acknowledged him his superior in controversy, and during
the disputation it was said of the three bishops: “Latimer
leaneth to Cranmer, Cranmer leaneth to Ridley and Ridley to
the singularity of his own wit”. Nevertheless in arguing, he
always referred to Cranmer’s book.</p>

<p>Latimer joined to the Puritan sympathies of Hooper the
weakness of character which signalised Cranmer. He had
been so deeply imbued with the spirit of the German divines
as to lose Henry’s favour, but as he ardently advocated the
King’s first divorce, Anne Boleyn procured him a bishopric.
He was however regarded with some suspicion, and was twice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
convented before Convocation, and required to subscribe to
certain articles presented to him for his acceptance. He
refused, was pronounced contumacious and excommunicated,
until he retracted, and sued for forgiveness. He was ultimately
pardoned, but relapsed into Protestantism, and was
only saved from prosecution by a timely utterance in favour of
the divorce, when he was made Bishop of Worcester. In 1536
he was called on to examine some Anabaptists for heresy,
and saw no reason why they should not suffer the rigour of
the law for their opinions. Later, he thus defended their
execution: “This is a deceivable argument,” said Latimer “he
went to his death boldly: ergo he standeth in a just quarrel.
The Anabaptists that were burnt here in divers towns in
England (as I heard of credible men, I saw them not myself)
went to their death even intrepid, as ye will say, without any
fear in the world, cheerfully. Well, let them go. There was
in the old doctor’s time another kind of poisoned heretics
that were called Donatists, and these heretics went to their
execution as though they should have gone to some jolly
recreation or banquet, to some belly-cheer or to a play.”<a name="FNanchor_550_550"
id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>But in spite of these words, Latimer was soon afterwards
as busy as any Anabaptist in destroying images, and during
the reaction of Henry’s orthodoxy, in the matter of the <i>Six
Articles</i>, was in some danger. Cromwell forced him to resign
his see,<a name="FNanchor_551_551"
id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
and he was kept in a sort of honourable confinement
by the Bishop of Chichester. On his release, he was forbidden
to preach, to go to either university or to return to
his diocese. He found himself in the Tower, in 1546, for his
openly professed disbelief in Purgatory, but was liberated on
Edward’s accession, and licensed as a preacher. Latimer
threw in his lot boldly with Somerset’s Protectorate, and
when Admiral Seymour was executed, and the people murmured,
he justified his death from the pulpit, and told them
that the Admiral had gone to everlasting damnation. The
passages in his sermon in which this sentiment was expressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
were afterwards eliminated as too scandalous for Latimer’s
credit as a divine. His eloquence was so overwhelming, that
its effect was generally to excite the people on whatever
subject he preached, and an entry in the churchwardens’
accounts of St. Margaret’s, Westminster, records the fact that
the sum of one shilling and sixpence was paid some time in
1549, “for mending of divers pews that were broken when
Dr. Latimer did preach”.<a name="FNanchor_552_552"
id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>
When in 1550, a fresh commission
was appointed to eradicate heresy, and to enforce
the new <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>, Latimer was one of the
thirty-two commissioners. On Mary’s accession, the Council,
for some reason unknown, declared his behaviour seditious,
and sent him a close prisoner to the Tower, denying him the
liberty accorded to Cranmer and Ridley. The latter, however,
contrived to communicate with him, and the two together
wrote a defence of their opinions, through the intermediary
of Latimer’s servant, who was allowed to attend him. After
the Oxford disputation in October 1555, Cardinal Pole wrote
to Philip, telling him that he had received letters from the
King’s confessor, Friar Soto, who had been sent to persuade
the prisoners to recant, and that Soto had given him an
account of what he had done “with those two heretics, Ridley
and Latimer after their condemnation”. One of them would
not even speak to him, and although the other spoke, “it
profited nothing, it being easily intelligible than no one can
save those whom God has rejected, and thus according to
report, the sentence was executed, the people looking on not
unwillingly, as it was known that nothing had been neglected
with regard to their salvation”.<a name="FNanchor_553_553"
id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>Giovanni Michiel also informed his Government that the
execution of the sentences “against the heretics, the late
Bishop of London, Ridley, and Latimer, Bishop of Worcester
had been decided on, there being no hope or visible
sign of their choosing to recant”.<a name="FNanchor_554_554"
id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
Gardiner had nothing to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
do with the conviction of the two bishops, beyond the fact
that, as Chancellor, he was at the head of the civil power
which passed sentence upon them. He is known to have
been personally averse from the persecution, and, as we have
already seen, he substantially helped some of the suspects to
leave the country before proceedings could be taken against
them. None the less, however, Foxe goes out of his way to
attribute to him the most horrible and inhuman desire for,
and satisfaction at, their death. The apparent object of the
martyrologist was to draw his favourite inference in regard
to the temporal judgment of God on miscreants. He says,
admitting that he obtained his information at <i>third</i> hand:
“The same day, when Bishop Ridley and master Latimer
suffered at Oxford (being about the 19th day of October)
there came into the house of Stephen Gardiner the old duke
of Norfolk, with the foresaid Master Munday his secretary
above named reporter hereof. The old aged duke, there
waiting and tarrying for his dinner, the bishop being not yet
disposed to dine, deferred the time to three or four o’clock at
afternoon. At length, about four of the clock cometh his
servant, posting in all possible speed from Oxford, bringing
intelligence to the bishop, what he had heard and seen: of
whom the said bishop, diligently inquiring the truth of the
matter, and hearing by his man, that fire most certainly was
set unto them, cometh out rejoicing to the duke. ‘Now,’ saith
he, ‘let us go to dinner’. Whereupon they being set down,
meat immediately was brought, and the bishop began merrily
to eat. But what followed? The bloody tyrant had not eaten
a few bits, but the sudden stroke of God’s terrible hand fell
upon him in such sort as immediately he was taken from the
table, and so brought to his bed, where he continued the space
of fifteen days in such intolerable anguish and torments ...
whereby his body being miserably inflamed within (who had
inflamed so many good martyrs before) was brought to a
wretched end.”<a name="FNanchor_555_555"
id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>The first thing to be observed in this story is the notable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
fact, that “the old duke of Norfolk” could not by any possibility
have dined with Gardiner on the 19th October 1555,
having been in his grave since August 1553. As for “the
sudden stroke of God’s terrible hand,” by which the Bishop
was brought to a wretched end, he had been suffering for
some time from dropsy,<a name="FNanchor_556_556"
id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>
and died of it, not in his own house,
but at Whitehall, to which place he had been removed, after
making an heroic effort to appear at the opening of Parliament
on the 21st October. It was an act of devotion to the
Queen and the country; the long speech which he then delivered
on the state of the royal finances, resulting in a subsidy
which removed the most pressing difficulties of the Crown.
But his strength was exhausted by the strain; he was too
weak to be taken home, and was therefore accommodated in
Whitehall Palace, till his death on the 12th November. He
desired during his last hours, that the Passion of our Lord
Jesus Christ might be read to him, and when the reader
came to the contrition of St. Peter, Gardiner exclaimed:
“Negavi cum Petro, exivi cum Petro, sed nondum flevi cum
Petro,” alluding to his fall in Henry’s reign.<a name="FNanchor_557_557"
id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<p>Cranmer’s execution was delayed for more than five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
months after the execution of Ridley and Latimer, in the
hope of his recanting. In the same letter, in which he communicated
to Philip the fact of the burning of the two bishops,
Cardinal Pole said:—</p>

<p>“The late Archbishop of Canterbury whose sentence of
condemnation is now expected from Rome, does not show
himself so obstinate, and desires a conference with me. If
he can be brought to repent, the Church will derive no little
profit from the salvation of a single soul; but they are
awaiting what may be expected, from the next letters of
Father Soto, and will certify it to your Majesty.”</p>

<p>From his prison in Bocardo, Cranmer had seen his two
companions led to the stake, and the sight had awakened
that natural timidity which underlay and prompted his least
praiseworthy actions. It has been said of him that in his
youth, he was cowed and crushed by a tyrannical master, and
so deprived of all manliness of character.<a name="FNanchor_558_558"
id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> He had a legal
rather than a broad or elevated mind, and this was of service
to him in keeping clear of the pitfalls, into which so many of
his friends fell, at least temporarily. It had also enabled him to
avail himself of the tide, which taken at the flood led on to
fame and fortune. He went to Cambridge at the age of fourteen,
but although he remained there for many years, his name
does not once appear among the learned or distinguished men
of the University. Erasmus, who knew every one with any
claim to notice, lived in the same street with him, but makes
no mention of him in his letters.</p>

<p>Cranmer took his degree of B.A. at the age of twenty-two,
and proceeded M.A. three years later. The fact of his marriage,
by which he forfeited the fellowship of his college (Jesus),
implies that he had then no intention of taking orders; and
he probably meant to adopt the law as a profession.<a name="FNanchor_559_559"
id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> His
first wife was the daughter of an innkeeper, known by the
name of Black Joan. To support himself and her, he accepted
a readership at Buckingham Hall, afterwards Magdalene
College, and lived with his wife at the Dolphin, her father’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
inn. But Black Joan died in childbirth, and Cranmer was
then reinstated in his fellowship. He proceeded D.D., and
was ordained in 1523, at the age of thirty-four. Either
Gardiner, or Fox, Bishop of Hereford, first brought him to
the King’s notice, by quoting a shrewd remark which Cranmer
had made, on the subject of Henry’s “private matter”.</p>


<p>“Who is this Dr. Cranmer?” asked the King. “Where
is he? Is he still at Waltham? I will speak to him; let him
be sent for out of hand. This man I trow has got the right
sow by the ear.”<a name="FNanchor_560_560"
id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>The interview proved satisfactory, and Henry charged
Cranmer to draw up a statement of his view of the King’s
marriage. In order to be able to confer often with him, he
lodged him in the household of the Earl of Wiltshire, Anne
Boleyn’s father, at Durham Place. A royal chaplaincy was
conferred on him, besides the emoluments of the Archdeaconry
of Taunton. He visited Rome with Lord Wiltshire, and the
Pope, unsuspicious of what was being plotted, made him
Grand Penitentiary for England. He then went to Germany,
on private business of his own, and there married Osiander’s<a name="FNanchor_561_561"
id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
niece. At this juncture Warham died, and Henry, who saw
that Cranmer was “an admirable tool, so timid that he could
ever be terrorised into submission, so tender with himself that
the King’s policy admirably fitted in with his sensuality,”
advanced him over the heads of better men, and made him
Primate of all England. Probably the dignity was unsolicited,
possibly undesired, and perhaps it was even thrust upon him
with unwillingness on his part. If he had aspired to it, he
would scarcely, as things then were, have married a second
time, nor would he have delayed his return to England, after
the death of Archbishop Warham. Ambition had no inordinate
share in his character. But he had signified to the
King, that sentence as to the validity of his marriage should
be given, not by the Pope, but by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
and it was to this opinion that his sudden promotion
was due.<a name="FNanchor_562_562"
id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
The bulls from Rome were to be obtained at the
cost of any duplicity, and they were in Henry’s hands before
the Pope had any inkling of what was intended.</p>

<p>The appointment was unpopular in England. Cranmer
was still comparatively unknown, and had as yet done nothing
to justify the extraordinary rise in his fortunes. Public opinion
had designated Gardiner as Warham’s successor, and under
normal conditions, he would probably have been chosen. But
lately, he had shown himself less pliable than suited Henry’s
convenience, and the King knew that he could count absolutely
on Cranmer, who was accordingly consecrated on the
30th March, which that year fell on Passion Sunday. Immediately
before the ceremony, the new Archbishop called four
witnesses, and in their presence declared before a notary, that
he did not intend to bind himself, by the oath of obedience to
the Pope which he was about to take, to do anything that
should appear to him contrary to the law of God, the King’s
prerogative or the statutes of the realm. When he knelt to
take this oath, he repeated his protest, and immediately afterwards
swore obedience to the Pope in the usual form. Just
before receiving the pallium, he made his third protest, and
again took the oath of obedience.<a name="FNanchor_563_563"
id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately after pledging himself to obey the Pope, he
took the following oath to the King for his temporalities:
“I Thomas Cranmer renounce and utterly forsake all such
claims, words, sentences and grants which I have of the
Pope’s Holiness in his Bulls of the Archbishopric of Canterbury,
that in any manner, wise, is or may be hurtful or
prejudicial to your Highness, your heirs, successors, estate or
dignity royal, <i>knowledging myself to take and hold the said
Archbishopric immediately and only of your Highness and of
none other</i>,” etc.<a name="FNanchor_564_564"
id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>Cranmer had been made Archbishop, solely that he might
advance “the King’s matter” which had little chance of being
settled at Rome according to the royal pleasure. Therefore
on the 3rd May, he rendered his first service to Henry by
pronouncing a sentence, declaring that his marriage with
Katharine of Arragon was invalid. On the 28th, he further
declared Henry’s union with Anne Boleyn good and valid,<a name="FNanchor_565_565"
id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
and to stop men’s tongues, prohibited all preaching throughout
his diocese till further notice, a measure that was significant
of public opinion.</p>

<p>In May 1536, the man whom Anne had virtually made
Archbishop, and who had made her Queen, at Henry’s
command, declared and decreed that “the marriage between
our sovereign lord the King and the lady Anne had always
been without effect”. In January 1540, he married Anne of
Cleves to the King, and six months later, pronounced her
sentence of divorce. In 1541, he favoured Henry with yet
another decree <i>nisi</i>, to relieve him of his fifth wife, Katharine
Howard. He examined Friar Forest on his refusal to acknowledge
the King as supreme Head, and handed him over to
his executioners. But the visit of the German Lutherans, to
negotiate the terms of union between the Church of England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
and the reformed Churches of the Continent, marked a crisis
in his life, and the seeds of Protestantism were sown which
were to bear abundant fruit in the next reign.<a name="FNanchor_566_566"
id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Nevertheless,
he still maintained the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation,
and condemned John Lambert and Anne Askew to the flames
for maintaining the contrary, while later on, he sentenced
Joan Bocher to death for holding that Christ was not incarnate
of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He also handed over several
Anabaptists to the secular arm, to be burned at Smithfield.</p>

<p>On Henry’s promulgation of the <i>Six Articles of Religion</i>,
one of which forbade the marriage of priests, Cranmer was
obliged to dismiss his wife. For some time past, it had cost
him no little trouble and inconvenience to conceal her presence
at Lambeth, where she lived in more than oriental seclusion.
When he travelled, he was obliged to carry her from place to
place in a chest, with holes contrived to allow of her breathing.
On one lamentable occasion the chest was placed the wrong
side uppermost, which so incommoded her that she was forced
to betray her presence by screaming.<a name="FNanchor_567_567"
id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>Cranmer was never popular with his clergy. “Of all sorts
of men,” he complained, “I am daily informed that priests
report the worst of me.” Conspiracies were even set on foot
against him, but he was too useful to Henry to fear a fall,
and was the one man in the realm to whom the King was
ever faithful. To all complaints against the Archbishop
Henry turned a deaf ear. “I would you should well understand,”
said he, “that I account my lord of Canterbury as
faithful a man towards me as ever was prelate in this realm,
and one to whom I am many ways beholden.” The praise
was certainly not exaggerated. Even in matters of purely
theological moment, Cranmer was never at variance with his
master, for he held no opinion or doctrine that was not
at Henry’s service. Incredible as it seems, Cranmer once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
said to him: “This is mine opinion and sentence at this
present, which nevertheless I do not temerariously define,
but refer the judgment thereof wholly unto your Majesty”.<a name="FNanchor_568_568"
id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>
Speaking in Cranmer’s defence, the Archbishop’s secretary
Morice unconsciously deprived him of every vestige of fidelity
to principle. “Men ought to consider,” he pleaded, “with
whom he had to do, specially with such a prince as would
not be bridled, nor be against-said in any of his requests.”<a name="FNanchor_569_569"
id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a></p>

<p>In deference to the wishes of the Council, he made several
alterations in the oath administered to the King at Edward’s
coronation, but he said the prescribed Mass of the Holy Ghost,
and also sang a Requiem for the repose of Henry’s soul. Nevertheless,
the whole tendency of the new Government was in
sympathy with his private feelings, and it was not long before
he made up his mind to swim with the tide. He headed a
commission which deprived Bonner and Gardiner, and held a
visitation of his diocese, to ascertain whether the destruction
of images had been fully carried out. A bill having been
passed in Parliament, “to take away all positive laws made
against the marriage of priests,” Cranmer sent for his wife,
invested in Abbey lands the money granted to him by Henry
and confirmed by Edward’s Council, invited Peter Martyr,
Martin Bucer and other Calvinists to settle in England, and
did all he could to promote union between the Church of
England, and the reformed Churches of the Continent. He
renounced the Mass, advocated the overthrow of the altars
and declared transubstantiation to be heresy. The <i>Book of
Common Prayer</i> which he had compiled and put forth in
1551, under the auspices of the Government, having been
criticised by the foreign Protestants, he set about its revision,
aided by the Bishop of Ely. The so-called Black Rubric,
which forbade the practice of kneeling at the Communion,
was introduced a little later. Towards the close of 1552,
the forty-two articles, afterwards reduced to thirty-nine, were
published by the King’s command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>Cranmer was instrumental in Seymour’s execution, and
by his treachery was partly responsible for Somerset’s fall.
His abject submission to the upstart lords of the Council of
Regency led to an act of high treason, by inducing him to
sign Edward’s will drawn up by Northumberland.<a name="FNanchor_570_570"
id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Had
Mary really possessed the vindictive feelings attributed to
her, she had ample pretext for ordering his apprehension,
thus avenging her own and her mother’s cause. But it was
not until some time after the rebellion, when Cranmer had
signalised himself by an act of open and aggressive opposition
to her measures, that his liberty was threatened. Even
then, opportunity was given him to escape if he had so willed.
On his committal to the Tower, he was charged with having
caused the Lady Jane to be proclaimed, and for sending
twenty armed men to Cambridge to aid Northumberland.
He pleaded not guilty, but afterwards withdrew the plea,
and confessed to the indictment. He was then sentenced for
treason, and would have been executed at Tyburn, but was
saved by Mary’s clemency. Being sent to Oxford with
Latimer and Ridley, to dispute with the most learned scholars
in both universities, he appeared at St. Mary’s before the
prolocutor, Dr. Weston, and thirty-three commissioners, and
was presented with three articles setting forth the doctrine of
the Mass, drawn up by Convocation. All three bishops
refused to subscribe to them, and a disputation was appointed
for the following Monday.</p>

<p>The day’s proceedings had been opened by a sermon from
Dr. Weston on the unity of the Church, which he accused
Cranmer of having violated by making, as it were, every year
a new faith. The Queen, he said in conclusion, had commissioned
the doctors assembled, on his repentance, to restore
him to the unity of the Church.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for the disputation, Dr. Chedsey,
Prebendary of St. Paul’s, afterwards a Canon of Christ Church,
Oxford, was Cranmer’s principal opponent, and kept up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
discussion for nearly six hours, at the end of which time the
assembly dispersed crying, <i>Vicit Veritas!</i> Cranmer wrote an
account of what had passed, and complained to the Council that
he had been unfairly treated in argument. He begged them
to obtain for him the Queen’s pardon. Thereupon he was
allowed to reopen the subject with John Harpsfield, a divinity
student, and Dr. Weston,<a name="FNanchor_571_571"
id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
but in the end, it was declared that
neither Cranmer nor the other two bishops had successfully
maintained their <i>theses</i>, and they were all sent back to Bocardo.
Here they remained for eighteen months, continually pressed
to recant. It was then decided that they should have a
formal trial for heresy, and Cardinal Pole, as Papal Legate,
was appointed to conduct it. The proceedings with regard to
Cranmer, as Primate of all England, were different from those
observed with the Bishops of London and Worcester. He was
cited to appear at Rome, to answer the charges made against
him, but this was a mere matter of form, as he was a prisoner,
and the Pope commissioned Cardinal Dupuy, who delegated his
functions to the Bishop of Gloucester, to represent his Holiness.<a name="FNanchor_572_572"
id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
But Cranmer refused to recognise the Pope’s authority,
declaring that he had sworn never again to consent to papal
jurisdiction. On being reminded that he had also sworn
obedience to Rome, he sheltered himself behind the protest
which he had made before doing so. Sixteen charges in all
were formulated against him, supported by eight witnesses.
He admitted the facts, but not their interpretation, and objected
to the witnesses as having also formerly abjured the
Pope. A report of the trial having been sent to Rome, Cranmer
wrote to the Queen, complaining that his “own natural
sovereign” had cited him before a foreign tribunal. Judgment
was at last pronounced against him for heresy in the
papal courts, and he was accordingly deprived, but the
sentence of degradation was not carried out for five months,
during which time no efforts were spared to save him. A
papal commission was then issued to Bonner, Bishop of
London, and Thirlby, Bishop of Ely, for his degradation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
The scene was a painful one, and Dr. Thirlby is said to have
been moved to tears during the ceremony. The day fixed
for it was the 14th February 1556. Cranmer was brought
before the two bishops at Christ Church, and the function
took place outside the church, in the great quadrangle. He
was clothed successively in vestments proper to a sub-deacon,
a deacon, a priest, a bishop and an archbishop, one over the
other, but all made of canvas, with a mitre and pallium of the
same material.</p>

<p>Lastly, a crosier was put into his hand, and Bonner
standing before him, declared the cause of his degradation,
Cranmer interrupting him at intervals with protests and
retorts. When the ceremony of unvesting began, he refused
to yield up the crosier, which was then wrested from him by
force, and when the pallium was to be removed, he exclaimed,
“Which of you, having a pallium is able to divest me of
mine!” They replied, that they held their commission from
the Pope. He then drew out of his sleeve a formal protest,
appealing from the Pope to a General Council, and handed
the document to Thirlby, who took it, saying, “Well, if it
may be admitted it shall,” and bursting into tears, he promised
to petition the Queen for a pardon. When Cranmer had
been stripped of all the vestments, with appropriate words
and ceremonies at each of them, he was degraded from his
minor orders, after which his hair was closely cut, and Bonner
proceeded to scrape his hands, at the places where he had
been anointed priest. His gown was then taken off, and that
of a yeoman substituted, in which he returned to prison.
This was the regular form of degrading a bishop.</p>

<p>Thirlby was as good as his word. Cranmer had drawn up
two separate forms of submission before his degradation, and
in consequence of these, a pardon such as had been granted to
other recanters, was contemplated by the Council. But it was
finally decided that the enormity of his offences required that
he should suffer “for ensample sake”. During the six weeks
which intervened before his execution, he made repeated recantations
“without fear, and without hope of favour” as he
himself said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
“for the discharge of his conscience, and as a
warning to others,” abjuring his former errors, and “beseeching
the people, the Queen and the Pope, to pray for his
wretched soul”.</p>

<p>He signed in all seven recantations, and it was expected
that he would read the last of them at his execution. But
instead of doing so, at the supreme moment, he repudiated
them all, expressing repentance for having written “contrary
to the truth which I thought in my heart, and writ for fear of
death”.<a name="FNanchor_573_573"
id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
Being bound to the stake, he is said to have thrust
his right hand into the flame exclaiming: “This hand hath
offended”.<a name="FNanchor_574_574"
id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
From first to last, he had proved himself so base
a dissembler, that no confidence could possibly have been
placed in the sincerity of his recantations. That he had lied
therein also, he admitted by his final recantation of them all.</p>

<p>Cranmer suffered according to the notions of the day,
on his own principles, and for causes which he had himself
judged sufficient for death. He had not only sent men and
women to the stake for the very same opinions which he
afterwards professed, and had burned Catholics because they
would not acknowledge the King’s supreme Headship, but
had also burned Protestants because their Protestantism
differed from his own. All things considered, it was wonderful
that he did not receive shorter shrift, and we do not find
that his miserable end excited much regret or pity among his
contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_575_575"
id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>It was part of Foxe’s method, in claiming for his martyrs
the sympathy of his readers, to cast as much odium as
possible on their judges. Thus, Bonner, Bishop of London,
has been made to appear an extremely violent persecutor,
although after the publication of his articles in 1554, he was
rather the reverse of zealous in enforcing the revived statute.
But whatever may be said for or against it, it was the law
of the land, and Bonner could no more help sitting on the
Bench in his own diocese to examine into the offences
committed against it, than could any other judge of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
court over which he had jurisdiction. His functions were
purely judicial, and it does not anywhere appear that he was
guided by passion, or that he overstepped his prerogative.
He had, on the contrary, been somewhat negligent in the
exercise of the duty which the law imposed on him, and hence
the reprimand which he received in the following letter from
the King and Queen in Council:—</p>

<p>“Right reverend Father in God, right trusty and well-beloved,
we greet you well. And whereas of late, we
addressed our letters to the justices of peace, within every
of the counties of this our realm, whereby, amongst other
instructions given them for the good order and quiet government
of the country round about them, they are willed to have
a special regard unto such disordered persons as (forgetting
their duty towards God and us) do lean to any erroneous and
heretical opinions, refusing to show themselves conformable
to the Catholic religion of Christ’s Church; wherein, if they
cannot by good admonitions and fair means reform them,
they are willed to deliver them to the ordinary, to be by him
charitably travailed withal, and removed (if it may be) from
their naughty opinions; or else if they continue obstinate,
to be ordered according to the laws provided in that behalf:
understanding now, to our no little marvel, that divers of
the said disordered persons, being by the justices of peace
for their contempt and obstinacy, brought to the ordinaries
to be used as is aforesaid, are either refused to be received
at their hands, or if they be received, are neither so travailed
with, as christian charity requireth, nor yet proceeded withal,
according to the order of justice, but are suffered to continue
in their errors, to the dishonour of Almighty God, and dangerous
example of others; like as we find this matter very
strange, so we have thought convenient both to signify
this our knowledge, and therewith also to admonish you to
have in this behalf such regard henceforth to the office of
a good pastor and bishop, as when any such offenders shall
be by the said officers or justices of peace brought unto you,
you, to use your good wisdom and discretion, in procuring
to remove them from their errors, if it may be; or else in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
proceeding against them (if they shall continue obstinate)
according to the order of the laws; so as through your good
furtherance, both God’s glory may be better advanced, and
the Commonwealth more quietly governed. Given under our
signet, at our honour of Hampton Court, the 24th May, the
first and second years of our reigns.”<a name="FNanchor_576_576"
id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>It will be admitted that the above document does not
correspond in any sense to the “rattling letters” by which
popular historians suppose Mary to have stimulated the zeal
of her “bloody executioners”. Its tone is calm, judicial,
charitable and even wise, if we consider the stand-point from
which the great majority then regarded any divergence from
authorised doctrine.</p>

<p>Foxe would have us believe that Bonner entertained a
furious, personal grudge against those who were brought to
be examined, and the pages of the <i>Acts and Monuments</i> teem
with such picturesque allusions to him as “bloody wolf,” “the
bishop being in a raging heat, as one clean void of humanity,”
“he was in a marvellous rage,” “in a great fury,” etc.; but
when we divest the stories of these adornments, there is little
or nothing to support the epithets. As a learned writer has
aptly remarked, this kind of description reminds us of the
mountain being in labour, and bringing forth—a mouse.<a name="FNanchor_577_577"
id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
For when we examine what Bonner, even according to Foxe,
really did say, on the occasion of his appearing before the
Commissioners of the Council in 1549 when he was supposed
to be in such a “raging heat,” that he appeared “as one clean
void of humanity,” we find that turning himself about to the
people he said: “Well, now, hear what the Bishop of London
saith for his part”. But the Commissioners “seeing his inordinate
contumacy, denied him to speak any more, saying
that he had used himself very disobediently”.<a name="FNanchor_578_578"
id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Equally
unjustified by the context are most of the other vituperative
epithets, by which the martyrologist sought to prejudice Bonner
in the minds of his credulous and uncritical readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span></p>

<p>The truth is, that when brought before the bishops, the
would-be martyrs, by Foxe’s own showing, frequently twitted
their judges, gave them home thrusts and “privy nips,” and
behaved themselves generally in a very insolent, provocative
and irritating manner. In spite of this however, the judges
seldom lost their tempers, and bore with these things in a
singularly good-humoured spirit, doing their best to give the
accused a chance of escape. Of the six who came under
Bonner’s examination on the 8th February 1555, Foxe affirms
that the bishop sentenced them the next day after they were
charged, and killed them out of hand without mercy, “such
quick speed these men could make in despatching their
business at once”—a terrible indictment if it could be proved.
But Bonner not only knew about the accused, long before
the 8th February, three of them having been for months in
prison, where he had again and again reasoned with them;
but after sentence was passed, an interval of five weeks was
the shortest respite granted for reflection, before any one of
them was executed. The others we find suffered consecutively
on the 26th, 28th and 29th March, and on the 10th June.</p>

<p>With as little accuracy did Foxe pen the following remarkable
distich, which however served his purpose of vilifying
Bonner.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
      <div class="verse">This cannibal in three years space three hundred martyrs slew,</div>
      <div class="verse">They were his food, he loved so blood, he sparèd none
	    he knew.<a name="FNanchor_579_579"
        id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Of the 200 persons who were burned for spreading opinions
considered subversive of public order, in the reign of
Mary, about 120 came under Bonner’s jurisdiction, so that
Foxe’s assertion that the Bishop of London “slew” 300 must
be discounted by more than half, leaving a sufficiently heavy
record. But his supposed thirst for blood has no foundation
in fact, for we have many instances of his labouring not unsuccessfully
in causing many to recant, upon which they were
restored to liberty. Instances of Foxe’s perversion of truth
might be multiplied, but enough has been said, to prove his
untrustworthiness wherever his prejudices are involved. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
appreciation of Bonner’s character from the pen of the late
Dr. S. R. Maitland will fitly close this chapter.</p>

<p>“In plainer terms, setting aside <i>declamation</i>, and looking
at the <i>details of facts</i> left by those who may be called if
people please, Bonner’s victims and their friends, we find
very consistently maintained, the character of a man, straightforward
and hearty, familiar and humorous, sometimes rough,
perhaps coarse, naturally hot-tempered, but obviously (by
the testimony of his enemies) placable and easily entreated,
capable of bearing most patiently, much intemperate and
insolent language, much reviling and low abuse directed
against himself personally, against his order, and against
those peculiar doctrines and practices of his church, for maintaining
which, he had himself suffered the loss of all things,
and borne long imprisonment. At the same time, not incapable
of being provoked into saying harsh and passionate
things, but much more frequently meaning nothing by the
threatenings and slaughter which he breathed out, than to
intimidate those on whose ignorance and simplicity argument
seemed to be thrown away—in short we can scarcely read
with attention any one of the cases detailed by those who
were no friends of Bonner, without seeing in him a judge
who (even if we grant that he was dispensing bad laws badly)
was obviously desirous to save the prisoner’s life.”<a name="FNanchor_580_580"

De Noailles told the Cardinal of Lorraine that the Queen of England
caused incessant prayers and processions to be made for obtaining peace; and
he declared that he believed her to be sincere, though he attributed less good
intentions to the Emperor (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ambassades</span></i>,
iv., p. 336). One of Cardinal Pole’s
letters in St. Mark’s Library at Venice, dated 20th April 1555, says that “last
evening the Queen sent for him [de Noailles] to show him the despatch she was
writing to her ambassador in France, charging him to tell the French King how
much she rejoiced at his being so well disposed towards the peace, and that she
also had performed every good office in favour of it with the Emperor”. A
peace conference was about to take place at Ardres, to which Mary had pledged
herself to send six commissioners.</p></div>

But it was not only to the poor that Mary showed kindness and a tender
charity. All sorts and conditions of men experienced her help in the hour of
need, one instance of which appeared in an article on Harrow School, in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i> for January 1899. This instance was taken from a letter
belonging to the Roper family, in which it is recorded, that after the death of
one of the family, who had been keeper of Enfield Chase and Marylebone
Forest, “Queen Mary came into our house within a little of my father’s death,
and found my mother weeping, and took her by the hand, and lifted her up—for
she neeled—and bade her be of good cheer, for her children should be well
provided for. Afterward my brother Richard and I, being the two eldest, were
sent to Harrow to school, and were there till we were almost men.”</p></div>

See Machyn’s <i>Diary</i>, p. 84. Wriothesley (vol. ii., p. 128) gives the sequel
to the outrage. “The xx day of April in the forenoon, in the consistory of Paul’s
was arraigned the said Wm. Branch <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">alias</span></i> Flower,
who struck the priest on
Easter Day in the parish church of St. Margaret in Westminster. And being
condemned of heresy, he was delivered to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex.
This Flower was once a monk in Ely Abbey, professed at his age of 17 years,
and after made priest, and then married and had three or four children; and
then ran about the country using the art of surgery. The 24 of April, the said
Wm. Flower, for his said fact, had his right hand smitten off, and for opinions in
matters of religion was burned in the sanctuary nigh to St. Margaret’s churchyard.”
Flower is included by Foxe among the martyrs.</p></div>

In a letter from Calvin to the Duke of Somerset in 1548, the Reformer
says: “As I understand you have two kinds of mutineers against the King and
the estates of the realm; the one are a fantastical people who under colour
of the Gospels would set all to confusion; the others are stubborn people in
the superstition of the Antichrist of Rome. These altogether do deserve to be
well punished by a sword, seeing they do conspire against the King and against
God who had set him in the royal seat. Of all things let there be <i>no moderation</i>.
It is the bane of genuine improvement” (MSS. Edward VI., vol. v.).</p></div>

On the 16th September 1555, Giovanni Michiel wrote to the Doge and
Senate: “After the Chancellor’s return from the conference at Calais, he fell
into such a state of <i>oppilation</i>, that besides having become (as the physicians
say) jaundiced, he by degrees got confirmed dropsy, and had it not been for his
robust constitution, a variety of remedies prescribed for him by his English
physicians having been of no use, he would by this time be in a bad way, his
physiognomy being so changed as to astound all who see him. The Emperor
has sent him the remedy he used when first troubled with dropsical symptoms,
on his return from the war of Metz, and should God grant that it take the same
effect on the Bishop of Winchester, it will be very advantageous for England, he
being considered one of the most consummate chancellors who have filled the
post for many years, and should he die, he would leave few or none so well
suited to the charge as himself” (<i>Venetian Calendar</i>, vol. vi., pt. i., 215, Rawdon
Brown).</p></div>

“The xiii day of November doctor Gardiner bishop of Winchester and
lord chancellor of England died in the morning, between twelve and one of the
clock at the king’s palace, the which is called Whitehall, and by iij of the clock
he was brought by water to his own palace by Saint Mary Overy’s; and by v
of the clock, his bowels was taken out, and buried afore the high altar; and at
6 the knell began there, and at dirge and Mass continued ringing all the bells,
till vij at night” (Machyn, p. 96).</p></div>

This oath, which is to be found in the original Latin, in Cranmer’s own
Register, at Lambeth Palace, Strype claimed to have copied <i>verbatim</i> therefrom,
and he refers his readers to a document in the appendix to his <i>Memorials of
Cranmer</i>. On turning however to this reference, we find only a shortened and
garbled version of that which Cranmer wrote with his own hand. Strype
evidently confused the two oaths, the one which Cranmer took before his consecration,
and that which he pronounced on receiving the pallium, with the
result that neither is correctly given, Strype omitting a whole essential paragraph.
When the <i>Memorials</i> were re-edited, in 1848, by the Ecclesiastical History Society,
which declared that they had been verified as far as possible, and more correct
references added, wherever it appeared needful, the learned Dr. S. R. Maitland,
Librarian at Lambeth Palace, pointed out that no collation had been made
between the oath, as it stands in the first edition of Strype’s work, and the
original document. Canon Dixon, in treating of this matter, could not have
been aware of Strype’s blunder, or have seen Cranmer’s Register, for he says;
“When he took the oath or oaths of obedience to the Pope, he made many
omissions, and then with an easier conscience proceeded to the oath to the
King for his temporalities” (<i>History of the Church of England</i>, vol. i., p. 158).
The form which Cranmer in his Register admits that he took on receiving the
pallium is, with one or two slight verbal exceptions, the very same as that which
Burnet prints (book ii., ann. 1532) as “the old oath of canonical obedience to
the Pope”. For the text of Cranmer’s oath see Appendix E to this volume.</p></div>

</div>

<p class="ac noindent">THE FORSAKEN QUEEN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> had gone into retirement at Hampton Court, in the
spring of 1555, and had refused to relinquish the cherished
hope of maternity, till long after her physicians had pronounced
that hope vain. But at last in August, she yielded to entreaties,
and consented to remove to Oatlands, ostensibly that
the palace which the court had inhabited for so many months
might undergo a thorough cleansing, the rushes be changed
and the floors washed.</p>

<p>The despatches of the Venetian ambassador, Giovanni
Michiel, are very important and interesting, as regards the
history of the next two years. As he was neither a passionately
devoted friend of the Queen, like Renard, nor a
malicious foe, such as de Noailles, his correspondence has
a special value. Writing in his direct manner to the Doge
and Senate, on the 3rd August, he says:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>
<p>“The fact is, that the move has been made in order no
longer to keep the people of England in suspense about this
delivery, by the constant and public processions which were
made, and by the Queen’s remaining so many days in retirement,
seriously to the prejudice of her subjects; as not only
did she transact no business, but would scarcely allow herself
to be seen by any one but the ladies, who in expectation
of this childbirth, especially the gentlewomen and the chief
female nobility, had flocked to the court, from all parts of the
kingdom, in such very great numbers, all living at the cost
of her Majesty, that with great difficulty could Hampton
Court, although one of the largest palaces that can be seen
here or elsewhere, contain them. At present, by this change
of residence, an opportunity is afforded for dispensing with the
processions, without any scandal, and for the Queen to free herself
from expense, by giving permission to the greater part of
these ladies to return to their homes, under pretence of very
limited accommodation; and by degrees her Majesty has resumed
the audiences, and replaced other matters in their former
ancient state, the usual officials (I am told) resuming their
service about her person, and the females being removed.”
In the same despatch he says: “The reported insurrections
in the provinces, and which caused so much apprehension
some days ago, their origin having been subsequently ascertained
authentically, were found to be slight and unimportant,
part having arisen from a great concourse of men at a
grand periodical fair held in Warwickshire, when on account
of the price of wheat, which had been raised extraordinarily
by certain persons, who having a great supply, wished to sell
it in their own fashion, by reason of the backward season,
and the small hope of the present harvest, the summer being
so rainy and cold, that the like is not remembered in the
memory of man for the last fifty years, so that no sort of
grain or corn ripens, and still less can it be reaped, a prognostic
of scarcity yet greater than that of last year; so that
in part from this, owing to the murmurs and complaints of
the multitude, which were construed into rebellion, and partly
from a report circulated in Cornwall and Devonshire that the
most Serene Queen was dead, and that to deceive the people,
as they said was done in the time of King Edward, they
exhibited her effigy at the casement and not her real face;
so having half rebelled, they said they would come towards
the court to ascertain the fact. These disturbances were also
caused in part by a gentleman, who being on bad terms with
his tenants, who had risen against him, and not knowing in
what other way to suppress the outbreak, sent word to the
court, that they were in arms against the Queen, and the
falsehood being discovered, he together with eight others, who
originated the reports of the other unreal insurrections, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
deservedly imprisoned, everything, thank God, remaining
quiet and peaceable.”<a name="FNanchor_581_581"
id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of her bitter grief and disappointments; fed
with insults by the London Puritans, with revolt and rumours
of revolt at her door, Mary had at least one abiding consolation
in the love of the poor and afflicted, who looked upon her
as their true mother. Machyn, in chronicling her removal,<a name="FNanchor_582_582"
id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
says that on “the 3. day of August the Queen and King’s
grace removed from Hampton Court unto Oatlands, a palace
four miles off: as her grace went through the park for to take
her barge, there met her grace by the way, a poor man with
two crutches, and when that he saw her grace, for joy he threw
his staffs away and ran after her grace, and she commanded
that one should give him a reward”.</p>

<p>The court remained at Oatlands but just long enough to
purify the larger palace after its overcrowded and filthy condition,
and on the 19th Michiel writes:—</p>

<p>“Last week, their Majesties returned to Hampton Court,
the Lady Elizabeth remaining at the seat to which she went;
and now the Queen shows herself, and converses with everybody
as usual, her health being so good, as perhaps never
to have been better, to the universal surprise of all who see
her, but of delivery or pregnancy small signs are visible externally,
and no one talks or thinks of them any longer. As to
the King’s departure, he yesterday sent the Signor Carlo da
Sanguino, gentleman of the mouth, to Brussels (they say), to
fix his going, having already adroitly broached the topic to the
Queen, who will acquiesce; so it is said he will leave in eight or
ten days, postwise, leaving the greater part of his household, for
the sake of convincing the Queen by as many signs as he can,
that he purposes returning speedily; though on the contrary,
it is said more than ever, that he will go to Spain, and remove
hence his household, and all the others by degrees.”<a name="FNanchor_583_583"
id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a></p>

<p>On the 27th, he wrote from London:—</p>

<p>“Their Majesties came hither from Hampton Court yesterday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
morning, remaining merely to dine, and then went to
Greenwich, where the Queen will remain during the whole
time of the King’s stay beyond sea. On departing hence, his
Majesty had determined, when passing through London, to
show himself in public to the people on horseback, leaving
the Queen to follow him at leisure, by water as usual, but her
Majesty chose to give the City the satisfaction of seeing her
likewise in his company, she having made the determination
when in the very act of embarking; so having herself carried
in an open litter, she went accompanied, not only by the
English and Spanish nobility now at the court, but also by
the Cardinal Legate and the ambassadors, the Lord Mayor and
all the aldermen, having met her at Temple Bar, coming with
the royal insignia, and all the other solemnities, as customary
when the Queen appears in public. It is not to be told what
a vast crowd of people there was all along the road, which is a
very long one, nor yet the joy they demonstrated at seeing
their Majesties, which was really great, and the more as the
London populace were firmly convinced that the Queen was
dead; so when they knew of her appearance, they all ran from
one place to another, as to an unexpected sight, and one which
was well-nigh new, as if they were crazy, to ascertain thoroughly
if it was she, and on recognising and seeing her in better plight
than ever, they by shouts and salutations, and every other
demonstration then gave yet greater signs of their joy, inasmuch
as to their great comfort and that of her Majesty, they saw
her come with the King on one side of her and Cardinal Pole on
the other, both of whom are universally popular, by reason of
the reported kindness of their nature, and of which daily proof
is afforded by facts, so that the determination to make this
display, most especially at the present moment, has been very
useful. The King will leave Greenwich, as soon as he hears
that the fleet with which he is to cross, and which until yesterday
was here in the Thames to complete its outfit, shall be
off Dover. It consists of twelve ships and a galleon for his
Majesty’s person, armed and provided in the best fashion
possible, and in addition to this force, they are expecting
some Flemish ships, to render the passage-track yet more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
secure, as it is daily infested by Frenchmen, who without any
scruple, attack every vessel, in order to take out of them all
property and subjects belonging to the enemy....</p>

<p>“In the meanwhile, as may be imagined with regard to a
person extraordinarily in love, the Queen remains disconsolate,
though she conceals it as much as she can, and from what I hear,
mourns the more when alone, and supposing herself invisible
to any of her attendants. During this absence, Cardinal Pole
will reside with her, lodgings having been assigned to him in
the palace, that he may comfort and keep her company,
her Majesty delighting greatly in the sight and presence
of him.”</p>

<p>In a despatch dated 3rd September he describes Philip’s
departure:—</p>

<p>“Much to my pleasure, I accompanied Cardinal Pole and
the other noblemen, on the day when they went with the King
to his barge, to see him take leave of the Queen, who on that
occasion really expressed very well the sorrow becoming a
wife, and a wife such as she is, invested with the regal habit
and dignity, for without displaying much extrinsic disquietude,
though evidently deeply grieved internally, she chose to come
with him through all the chambers and galleries to the head
of the stairs, constraining herself the whole way, to avoid in
sight of such a crowd, any demonstration unbecoming her
gravity, though she could not but be moved when the
Spanish noblemen kissed her hand, and yet more, when
she saw the ladies in tears take leave of the King, who,
according to the custom of the country, kissed them one by
one.</p>

<p>“On returning however to her apartments, placing herself
at a window which looks on the river, not supposing herself
any longer seen or observed by any one, it was perceived that
she gave free vent to her grief by a flood of tears, nor did she
once quit the window, until she had not only seen the King
embark and depart, but remained looking after him as long
as he was in sight; and the King on his part, mounted aloft
on the barge in the open air, in order to be better seen when
the barge approached in sight of the window, and moreover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
waved his bonnet from the distance to salute her, demonstrating
great affection. Now, whilst his Majesty is at
Canterbury, not only every day but every hour, expresses are
on the road from the King to the Queen, and in like manner
from hence to his Majesty, the gentlemen in waiting being
always booted and spurred ready for a start. Shortly before
he departed, the King sent for Cardinal Pole, and all the
Lords of the Council into the chamber, and in very suitable
language recommended the government of the kingdom to
them during his absence, alluding especially to justice and
religion, leaving a writing, in which, as I was told by the
Legate, were noted all such warnings, as he deemed most
important and necessary, with a detailed list of such persons
as could be trusted and employed for any necessary business
or office, a matter which although discussed previously, surprised
every one by the judgment and tact displayed in it
by his Majesty, who then, thus in public, turning towards
Cardinal Pole, besought him very earnestly in his own name,
and that of the Queen, to assume this charge, in conformity
with his own patriotism and the wish of their Majesties, desiring
all the others to defer to him in everything. This same
office had been performed by the King with the Cardinal, the
day before, they being alone together, his Majesty for this
purpose having gone very privately in person to the Legate’s
own apartment, taking him quite by surprise. Cardinal Pole
told me, that by so much the less did he think fit to combat
the wish of his Majesty, as he trusted and was indeed certain
that the will of their Majesties being in accordance with
his natural obligation, would also have the approval of his
Holiness, from which by another second obligation, both as a
member of the apostolic see, and as the Pope’s representative
he could not depart. Henceforth, therefore to the great
comfort of their Majesties, and the whole kingdom, all public
and important business will be discussed and decided, according
to the opinion and advice of his right reverend Lordship,
who, for the avoidance of envy and molestation, will not interfere
with private and ordinary matters, leaving their despatch
as before, to the other members of the Council; and this will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
perhaps be the chief cause besides the others for his remaining
here.”<a name="FNanchor_584_584"
id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>Contrary winds detained Philip at Canterbury for five
days. So ardently did Mary desire, and affect to believe in
his immediate return, that she was very angry when she heard
that to save expense, the fleet which accompanied him to
Calais, had on his landing been dismissed and disarmed.
She ordered it to be at once fitted out again to be ready
against his return, little imagining that nineteen months
would elapse before it was needed. But she soon saw that
her intention to await him at Greenwich would have to be
abandoned, and she was obliged to depart to London to open
Parliament in person. Michiel writing to the Doge and Senate
on the 21st October, gives a graphic account of Gardiner’s last
great public act of devotion to the Queen’s service. He says:—</p>

<p>“The most serene Queen opened Parliament to-day, according
to the appointed term, coming from St. James’s,
whither she retired on her return from Greenwich, to sit, as
in the last Parliament, on a lofty and well-decorated throne,
carried by two mules, in the guise of a litter, accompanied in
state, not only by all the lords, barons and prelates of the
kingdom, clad in the habit suited to this occasion, but in
addition to these personages, by the most illustrious Legate
likewise, the Queen having chosen him to attend it for this
day, although not entitled legitimately to a seat in Parliament.
After the Mass of the Holy Ghost, sung by the Bishop of
Ely, and the sermon preached by the Bishop of Lincoln, her
Majesty proceeded into the great hall, where in the presence
of all those officially summoned, the Lord Chancellor having
rallied a little, choosing at any rate to be there, in order not
to fail performing his office on this occasion, made the usual
proposal, stating the cause for assembling Parliament, which
was, in short, solely for the purpose of obtaining pecuniary
supply. His right reverend Lordship laid before the House
the great need of the most Serene Queen, from having on her
accession found the revenues of the Crown so exhausted and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
consumed, that not only was she unable to avail herself of
them for the many and heavy expenses, which he enumerated
one by one, incurred by her compulsorily for the honour of
the realm, both before and after her marriage—with regard to
which he did not omit to say that King Philip, whilst in England
had spent much more than her Majesty,—but that having
found considerable debts left by her father and brother, she
had been compelled to make fresh ones for their acquittance,
still remaining responsible for a great part of the old ones.
Her Majesty, in the meanwhile had not chosen to avail
herself, as she might have done, of the taxes and subsidy
conceded by Parliament, to her brother King Edward,
amounting to upwards of 1,200,000 ducats, but remitted that
sum, for the sake of not burdening any one. Neither did she
choose, as she might and ought to have done in justice, to
avail herself of the revenues and estates of many of her rebels,
amounting to a very considerable sum, but to demonstrate
thoroughly her benignity and clemency, she made them a
free gift both of their lives and lands. Therefore, in the
Queen’s name, the Chancellor requested Parliament, in consideration
of the present public necessities, to devise means
for their relief, saying moreover, that at this commencement,
her Majesty had not chosen to keep this her proposal any
longer in suspense, nor allow it to be made by others than
by herself, but proceeding openly, had willed to proclaim and
announce it immediately, anticipating such speedy supply
as by reason of the great affection of her subjects she felt
sure she should witness. The Chancellor added that if any
member had anything else to suggest, to the profit and advantage
of the realm, and for the common weal, he was not
to omit doing so, in conformity with the obligation and duty
of everybody, nor to fail thus to act readily and willingly as
becoming; and his right reverend Lordship having spoken
with much more energy than by reason of his indisposition
any one would have expected, the business of this first day of
the session ended.”<a name="FNanchor_585_585"
id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>
<p>The long speech completely exhausted the strength of the
dying Chancellor. The effort he had made left him so weak
that, as we have already seen, he was unable to return to his
own house, and was taken to Whitehall, where he breathed
his last on the 12th November. But in consequence of his
representations, Parliament unanimously agreed to give the
Queen a million of gold, to be levied, in two years from the
laity, and in four from the clergy, “who contribute,” said
Cardinal Pole, “willingly to this subsidy, which free contribution
is a very ancient custom in England”.<a name="FNanchor_586_586"
id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<p>The death of Gardiner was perhaps the greatest misfortune
that could have happened to Mary at this time. He understood
the temper of the English nobility far better than Pole,
who had been so long absent, that in spite of the enthusiasm
he inspired among the people, he was not in touch with the
new generation of statesmen and courtiers whom he found in
power. Nor had he the business qualities which had enabled
Gardiner to steer the Queen’s financial barque safely among
the troubled waters. Moreover, Gardiner, although of the
old school, had been generally able to lead and control,
always to make his influence felt in the Council, and whether
he agreed with her views or not, he was ever loyal to the Queen
and upheld her against all opponents. Pole was too entirely
one with her; their interests were too identical to constitute
him an independent influence in the State. Had he been
less near to the throne, less a kinsman and personal friend of
Mary’s, more a statesman and less an ecclesiastic, he might
more effectually have replaced Gardiner in the Queen’s
counsels. De Noailles with his usual shrewdness, in announcing
the Chancellor’s death to his master, expressed the
hope that it would greatly further their affairs in England.<a name="FNanchor_587_587"
id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>It was, without doubt, a severe blow to the Catholic party.
Some members of the Council influenced by Paget, whose
treachery and falsehood are responsible for many of Mary’s
troubles, inclined to a secret understanding with Elizabeth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
The Queen had had little choice in the formation of her
government, and although Paget had distinguished himself
as a Puritan under Edward, on his professing himself a
Catholic, she made him Lord Privy Seal, and gave him back
the Garter, which had been taken from him in 1552, for having
as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, made large profits
at the expense of the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_588_588"
id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
Having established himself in
Mary’s favour by furthering her marriage, he entered into
league with de Noailles, and with all the Queen’s enemies,
and his position at the Council board, especially after
Gardiner’s death, gave him almost unlimited power. The
Lords Arundel, Pembroke, Cobham, and Sir William Petre
were all swayed by him. He was the moving spirit of them
all, and little business was transacted without him. Mary
told the Cardinal that she had no longer perfect confidence
in any member of her Council, Pole himself being in the
King’s absence her only support.<a name="FNanchor_589_589"
id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth, meanwhile, was careful to give no direct cause
for suspicion. She openly declared herself a Catholic, was
often at court, and shared the Queen’s public devotions. On
the day of Philip’s departure, “the Queen’s grace and my lady
Elsabeth, and all the Court did fast from flesh, and took the
Pope’s Jubilee and pardon granted to all men”.<a name="FNanchor_590_590"
id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>While Mary felt her husband’s absence so keenly that
Sir Anthony Strelley, writing to the Earl of Rutland, says he
will speak to her about a certain piece of business, “as soon
as the Queen’s highness hath passed over her sorrowfulness
at the King’s departure into Flanders,” Philip was on his part
by no means anxious to hasten his return. The Emperor
welcomed him at Brussels with all the ceremony and display
of respect which Philip loved. They met at the Louvain
Gate, Charles having gone out to receive him. The King
dismounted and knelt to kiss his father’s hand, but the
Emperor raised him up, and doffing his bonnet prevented
him, by continuing to hold it. Philip then insisted on kissing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
his left arm, but his father embraced and kissed him so
lovingly “that tears came to his eyes”. They then mounted
their horses, and rode side by side, through respectful if not
enthusiastic crowds, to the imperial palace.</p>

<p>Philip’s conduct at Brussels, at this time, was not perfectly
in accordance with the reputation for gravity which he had
acquired by his haughty and reserved manners, and even the
Emperor showed some displeasure at his levity, in masquerading
about the streets in such troubled times, and was in
serious doubt as to his son’s capacity to bear the burden he
was about to lay on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Mary having heard that he was suffering from a slight
indisposition, the result of too much dissipation, sent over one
of her chamberlains to visit him. Philip sent him back with
protestations and thanks, and ordered him to announce to
the Queen his firm intention to fulfil his promise to return to
her, as soon as he had completed some business which obliged
him to go to Antwerp. Before leaving Brussels, the Chamberlain
remarked to some of the King’s attendants, that he
should gladly be the bearer of this good news, but that he
had promised “not to give account of his Majesty’s having
twice gone abroad in this wretched weather, and of his dancing
at weddings, as he feared lest the Queen who was easily
agitated might take it too much to heart”.<a name="FNanchor_591_591"
id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>But no sooner were Mary’s hopes raised, than they were
again dashed to the ground, by an order which Philip’s confessor,
Alfonso de Castro; his steward, Don Diego de Azevedo,
and the rest of his household received, to proceed immediately
to Spain, “An indication” says Michiel,<a name="FNanchor_592_592"
id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> “to some persons
that the intentions announced by King Philip to the Queen of
his being here at the Epiphany, are mere words”. Badoer,
the Venetian ambassador at Brussels, told the Doge<a name="FNanchor_593_593"
id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> that
this order had pained her intensely, as she took it for an
announcement, either that Philip would not return to England
for a long while, or that, should he return, he would shortly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
afterwards proceed to Spain, as was generally believed. “The
King’s confessor has arrived here,” continued Badoer, “and
repeated a variety of foul language, uttered by the English,
indicating their ill-will towards his Majesty, and the Spanish
nation, narrating the following incident, that on seeing him
and the rest of the royal attendants depart, they made great
rejoicing, well-nigh universally.” Philip’s relations with the
English in Brussels, and even with Mary’s ambassador there,
were observed to differ widely from the courtesy which had
characterised them in England, the outcome perhaps of his
irritation towards the nation in general, on account of their
persistent unwillingness to proceed to his coronation.</p>

<p>As the subject was much discussed in the official despatches
of the time, and as it served to increase the general discontent
as well as the Queen’s perplexities, it is deserving of more
notice than has been hitherto directed to it.</p>

<p>Mary’s continued inability to overcome the determination
of the Council not to bestow on him the Crown matrimonial
was perhaps more than anything else the cause of his alienation
from a wife whom he had never loved, and from a
country which he had every reason to dislike. His dignity
and his future stake in the realm appeared to him to be alike
threatened by the refusal, and dignity was to Philip the breath
of his nostrils, while political considerations had by long habit
become paramount over all others.<a name="FNanchor_594_594"
id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>
To utilise Mary’s affection
for these ends seemed to him as legitimate, as to employ
any other means to compass them, and his absence, which
caused the unhappy Queen intense pain and grief, was to be
a powerful factor in undermining her objections, by the skilful
manipulation of hope deferred. Moreover, to the demand
for his coronation, he added another of far greater moment, a
demand that the English should co-operate with him in the
long-talked-of war with France. To his first request Mary
replied that she did not venture to propose it in Parliament,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
so large a number of members of the opposition having been
returned, and as for the second, Cardinal Pole, of whom even
de Noailles spoke as “un homme pacifique,” sent over the
Abbot of San Saluto to confer with him. The following extract
from a letter from the Venetian ambassador at Brussels
shows the delicacy with which both questions were handled.
Badoer says that the Abbot, after treating of the peace “in
the name of the Queen, performed an earnest office with his
Majesty, apologising for her non-adoption of any of the resolutions
desired by him, in the matter of the coronation, or
with regard to waging war on the most Christian King, as
mentioned in my former letters, telling King Philip that when
she looks round, and carefully considers the persons about
her, she scarcely knows one who has not injured her, or who
would fail to do so again were the opportunity to present
itself, and that since she is Queen, the afflictions and perils
undergone by her have been, and still are, so great, on account
of the religion, and from anxiety to preserve public quiet,
besides other vexations, that she knew it to be impossible
to form either of these important resolutions, without greatly
endangering her crown; but that she hoped, in the course
of a short time, to comfort the King with what he seems to
desire; and in her Majesty’s name, and as his personal
servant, the Abbot exhorted him to go to England as soon
as possible, but I have heard from a person of quality that his
Majesty is not inclined to do so, and that the Emperor is of a
contrary opinion. King Philip however has written back to the
Queen, feeding her in general terms with this hope, and suggesting
that in the meanwhile she could fill up the important
offices now vacant, as he shall be satisfied with any appointment
made by her, but recommending Lord Paget and the English
ambassador in France (Dr. Wotton) for the Chancellorship.”<a name="FNanchor_595_595"
id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor had already conferred the sovereignty of
Naples and Milan on Philip at the time of his marriage;
on the 22nd of October 1555 he invested him with the Grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
Mastership of the Golden Fleece of Burgundy, the proudest
and most coveted of all the military orders of knighthood of
that day. These were but the preliminaries for his abdication
of the kingdom of the Netherlands, which he now, being only
in the fifty-sixth year of his age, formally ceded to his son<a name="FNanchor_596_596"
id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>
with the sovereignties of Castile and Arragon and their dependencies.
Philip at once despatched a gentleman to England
to give Mary notice, and to congratulate her on her being able
to style herself the Queen of many and great crowns, and on
her being no less their mistress than of her own crown of
England. He again assured her that on his return from Antwerp,
to which place he was going the next day, he would
remain a few days with the Emperor, and then go speedily to
her. Confiding in the truth of this assertion, Mary ordered
the fleet to drop down towards the sea forthwith, and a
guard of 100 halberdiers to be at Dover on the 20th January.
The Earl of Pembroke was to hold himself in readiness, from
one day to another, to go to Calais to receive his Majesty.<a name="FNanchor_597_597"
id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<p>And still Philip came not, nor had he apparently any
intention of coming. But seeing little present hope of drawing
England into a war with France, he concluded, in
February 1556, a truce with Henry II. for five years.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a formidable plot, known as Dudley’s conspiracy
to murder the Queen, and place Elizabeth on the throne, was
being hatched in London. It was revealed to Cardinal Pole
before the decisive moment, but it was some time before the
real nature and object of the design were brought to light. On
the 17th March, Michiel notified to the Doge: “For many
consecutive days, a comet has been visible as it still is, and
with this opportunity, a gang of rogues, some twelve in
number, who have been arrested, went about the city, saying
we should soon see the Day of Judgment, when everything
would be burned and consumed. These knaves, with a
number of others, availing themselves of this device, agreed
to set fire to several parts of the city, to facilitate their project
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
of murder and robbery, and if this be true, due punishment
will be inflicted on them.”<a name="FNanchor_598_598"
id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>A few days later, the affair assumed a more serious aspect,
and on the 24th Michiel continued his report:—</p>

<p>“The suspicion about the conspirators, who proposed
setting fire to several quarters of the city, for the sake of
plunder, had a different root and origin to what was reported,
a plot having been lately discovered of such a nature, that
had it been carried into effect as arranged, it would doubtless,
as generally believed, considering the ill-will of the majority
of the population here on account of the religion, besides their
innate love of frequent change and innovation, have placed
the Queen and the whole kingdom in great trouble, as it was
of greater circuit and extent than had been at first supposed.”</p>

<p>They were to have seized all the public money, by an
understanding with the officials of the Exchequer, and to
facilitate this, were to set fire to different parts of the city, and
to the palace, so that the population being occupied with the
conflagration, in the midst of the turmoil, they might do their

<p>The money, consisting chiefly of the bullion brought over
from Spain by Philip, was, on the discovery of the plot,
secretly removed from the Tower; but the conspirators were
left unmolested, and carefully watched. When the affair
seemed ripe, the ringleaders were caught in the act and
arrested. But even then, the whole extent of the plot, which
had been far more carefully planned than that of Wyatt and
his accomplices, had still to be discovered. The Queen was,
however, sufficiently alarmed not to allow Cardinal Pole, who
had been preconised Archbishop of Canterbury, to leave her
for the ceremony of his consecration, which was to have taken
place in his Cathedral Church, on the 25th March.<a name="FNanchor_600_600"
id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
therefore consecrated in the Church of the Grey Friars at
Greenwich, with great solemnity, and in presence of the
Queen and of the whole court, and in spite of his anxiety to
begin the exercise of his spiritual functions, the State burden
which the King and Queen had placed on his shoulders
pressed daily more and more heavily. The conspiracy, as it
was discovered piecemeal, resolved itself into a vast network
composed indeed of the usual meshes, spread by the French
King, his ambassador, Elizabeth, and her confederates
throughout the country, but it was bolder in design than
anything that had been hitherto conceived against Mary. Its
object, like Wyatt’s, was to depose and murder the Queen,
raise Elizabeth to the throne, and marry her to the Earl
of Devon. The charge to conduct it was entrusted by de
Noailles to Sir Henry Dudley, an offshoot of the disaffected
Northumberland family and faction, to whom the King of
France granted a considerable pension, in return for his
services. Elizabeth’s willing co-operation was brought to
light by the instructions sent to de Noailles from France,
one of the letters implicating her containing the following
passage: “Above all, you must prevent Madam Elizabeth
from making any sort of move to undertake what you have
written to me, for it would spoil everything, and lose the
advantage which they may expect from their plans, which
must be conducted carefully and slowly”.<a name="FNanchor_601_601"
id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>In order to arrange the final <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</span></i>,
Dudley, followed by three
other conspirators, sailed for France and landed in Normandy.
The moment was unfavourable, Henry II. having but just
concluded his truce for five years with Philip, and little as
considerations of honour and chivalry had ever entered into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
his dealings with Mary, he shrank from the odium he would
incur, in appearing as an accomplice, in a conspiracy against a
prince with whom he had sworn even a temporary friendship.
He therefore ordered Dudley and his friends to remain quiet,
and to counsel their allies in England to do the same, feigning
loyalty, until a more convenient season. The above-mentioned
instructions which he wrote to de Noailles concerning Elizabeth’s
part in their schemes, and the necessity for her quiescence
belong to this juncture. Dudley, and the three conspirators
who had followed him into France, continued to reside there,
and the discovery of the plot was the result of precisely the
same want of combined action that had impelled Wyatt to
break out into open revolt, six weeks before the time originally
agreed upon. The impatience of the plotters in London
brooked no delay; they disregarded the advice of their royal
ally, and their dark sayings in connection with the comet,
chronicled in Michiel’s despatch of the 17th March, first roused
the suspicion of the Government, and led to the arrest of Sir
Anthony Kingston, Throckmorton, Udal, Staunton and others,
about forty in number. Kingston had been sent to the Tower
some months previously, for seditious words, but had been
released by the Queen’s prerogative, Mary believing him to
be loyal at heart, in spite of his intemperate language. Now,
for the first time in her life, her courage seemed to be unequal
to the demands made upon it. She was greatly troubled, and
would no longer appear in public, and her depression communicated
itself to her friends. A panic among the loyalists
was however prevented, and confidence in a great measure
restored by the public appearance of Cardinal Pole, who on
the 25th March, preached in the church of St. Mary of the
Arches, on the occasion of his consecration and reception of
the pallium, “to the edification of many souls”. Alluding to
the cause of his return to England, he explained the meaning
of the pallium, and dwelt on the peace which he had come to
offer to his fellow-countrymen. He told his hearers that they
ought not to be slow to receive so great a benefit, offered to
them by the Divine mercy, lest there be said of them those
words uttered by Christ concerning Jerusalem, when drawing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
nigh to and weeping over the city He said: “If thou didst
know the things which belong to thy peace; but now are they
hidden from thine eyes”. His voice failed with emotion; he
remained silent for a moment, and then continued in a low
tone: “You know what has passed; I pray you guard against
the future,” and those words, says the chronicler, “if thou didst
know,” he pronounced with such tenderness, that not one of
his congregation remained unmoved.<a name="FNanchor_602_602"
id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<p>Never were details of conspiracy so slow to unfold themselves,
even long after the scheme had collapsed. When it
at last dawned upon the Government, that the traitors had a
special understanding with the King of France, the idea did
not even then present itself to their minds, that Elizabeth was
in any way implicated, and it was not till June, that attention
was turned to her household. But as early as the 14th April
Lord Clinton was commissioned, when Henry’s share in the
matter had become apparent, to proceed at once to France,
ostensibly to congratulate the King on the conclusion of his
truce with Philip, but he was also the bearer of instructions
from the Council, to demand Dudley and the other fugitives
at his hands, as “traitors, heretics and outlaws,” and to complain
of the harbour which it was understood he gave to
English rebels, “contrary to the agreement and express treaty
between the two crowns”. The envoy was compelled to set
out in such haste, and so suddenly, and in such confusion, that
neither he nor his attendants had time to provide themselves
with many necessary articles of apparel, which “for the sake
of dispatch were supplied them from the Queen’s wardrobe”.<a name="FNanchor_603_603"
id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
Henry affected ignorance of the case in point, and to Lord
Clinton’s representations, answered that his kingdom was so
large and free to every one, that he could not know so particularly,
either who entered it, nor who went out of it, but
that he heard with regret of the commotions in England.
“Notwithstanding which,” continued Sorranzo, Venetian ambassador
in France, in his letter to the Doge, “since several
days, there are several Englishmen here at the court, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
were subsequently outlawed from England, and are said to
have come to ask favour from his most Christian Majesty.”<a name="FNanchor_604_604"
id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
To Sorranzo, speaking of the complaint made by Clinton, that
he harboured the Queen’s rebels, and listened to their proposals,
Henry said:—</p>

<p>“I answered him that the malcontents of that kingdom were
in such number that they had already filled not only France
but the whole of Italy, and that it was true that they came to
me and proposed the most extravagant things possible, but
that I had never given ear to any of them; and to tell you the
truth, ambassador, I know the English well, and that they
are not to be trusted by any one. I have also heard, that in
England, they plotted to make Courtenay go back, but my
ambassador at Venice writes to me, that by no means will he
go thither.”<a name="FNanchor_605_605"
id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>Describing a former audience with Henry, Sorranzo says:
“The King added that he supposed I had heard of the
disturbances in England, and when I replied that they were
known to me in part, he continued: ‘They wanted to rob the
Queen’s treasury, and plotted to put her to death, so that
kingdom is more upside down than ever, and the Queen
wishes for her husband, who cares but little about it, but
through the coming of these ambassadors, whom the Queen
is sending, the future will be made manifest,’ and with this
the King closing the discourse, I thanked him again in your
Serenity’s name, and took leave. When speaking about
English affairs with the Constable, he said: ‘Ambassador, I
will tell you a thing privately, and do not forget it, as for my
own part, I believe it will certainly come true. I am of opinion
that ere long the King of England will endeavour to dissolve
his marriage with the Queen, and should this come to pass
remember then this prophecy.’”<a name="FNanchor_606_606"
id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>The embassy mentioned by Henry was the sending of
Lord Paget to Philip, according to Badoer, to find out the
true reason of his not coming, for he declared, “the said
Queen is beyond measure exasperated by what she considers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
this well-nigh contemptuous treatment”. The astute Venetian
went on to say: “It is very evident, from the language of the
chief Spaniards of these two Courts [the Emperor’s and the
King’s] that neither the arguments adduced by Paget nor
the adroit means employed by him to make the King go
to England, will take effect, unless he has a certain promise
from the Queen that she will crown him, in virtue of such
authority as, it is said, she might legally exercise, and with the
support of those who may be dependent on their Majesties,
by reason of offices and benefits received from them. The
French ambassador uses all diligence to ascertain whether
his Majesty will go to England or not, and according to
news-letters which he says he has received from thence, he
shows that the coronation may take place, and that Queen
Maria of Hungary is the person who well-nigh daily writes
autograph letters on this subject to the Queen of England,
exhorting her to put aside every consideration, and her
timidity, and to crown her husband, assuring her that
otherwise she will fail in what is due to herself, and to
right, and that consequently she will not have him with her.
It is said that Queen Maria acts thus by reason of the
extreme desire she has to resume the Regency of Flanders,
in which she cannot succeed, unless the King depart hence.”<a name="FNanchor_607_607"
id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>In a subsequent despatch, the same authority relates:
“The report also of King Philip’s going to England still
continues, but neither the ministers nor his Majesty himself
any longer assert that it will take place at the beginning
of next month, as he told Lord Paget, who went about
assuring everybody of this, and that he should go back with
his Majesty; but by taking leave of the Emperor yesterday,
to depart in three days, he has surprised everybody. Some
persons believe that the King has rather cooled about going so
immediately as was promised by him, owing to the confession
made to the Queen by one of the prisoners, that he had determined
to kill her consort; and some are of opinion that King
Philip has sent Lord Paget back, in order that he may return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
subsequently with the Earl of Pembroke, and other English
noblemen, to conduct him with more positive arrangements.
Don Juan Manrique, a member of the Privy Council, having
said that although the Queen professes here to resign herself
to the King’s will, it is nevertheless evident that she either
allows herself to be biased by her ministers, or that Paget has
promised more than he was commissioned to do. Others say
that his Majesty’s departure for England is delayed by the
hope of the coming hither of the King of Bohemia.”<a name="FNanchor_608_608"
id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Whatever
the Emperor and his son may have thought and intended,
all they did was to buoy Mary up with delusive hopes and
polite assurances, as before, and she gained nothing more from
the embassy that was to have done so much.</p>

<p>Lord Clinton arrived from France about the same time
that Paget returned from Brussels, bringing many declarations
of friendship from Henry; but far from offering to surrender
the traitors who had fled to his court, the French King said
openly that he would rather suffer in his own person, than fail
to receive and treat kindly any Englishmen of however low
degree, who might take refuge in his realm. “To-day,” adds
Michiel, “the French ambassador was a long while at the
palace, I believe about this business, concerning which should
I hear anything has passed worthy your Serenity’s notice, I
will not omit to give you notice of it by the first opportunity.”</p>

<p>Mary’s Government, now thoroughly on the alert, made
fresh discoveries and arrests daily. Carew, one of the chief
conspirators in Wyatt’s rebellion, and Dr. Cheke, formerly
tutor to Edward VI., were taken together in Flanders, and
sent to England. Strict watch was kept about the court, and
in Elizabeth’s household, and the Queen still refused to appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
in public, even on the solemn feast of the Ascension.
It was said that recognising the uselessness of her former
clemency, and the ingratitude of those who had before been
so freely pardoned, she had determined that all should suffer
the just punishment of their misdeeds.</p>

<p>But in fact, nothing was done without Philip’s advice, and
the courier Francesco Piamontese was continually on the road
between London and Brussels, bearing letters from the Queen
to the King, and <i>vice versâ</i>. On the day on which Paget
returned, Mary had two interviews with him, lasting upwards
of two hours. The next day, to the surprise of all, Piamontese
was on his way back to Flanders. “Many persons believe,”
wrote Michiel, “that this frequent despatch of couriers, during
the last few months, relates not only to the affair of the
prisoners, it being credible that the Queen acquaints her
consort with what takes place from day to day, and with
the discoveries made, and that this last mission of Francesco
in great part concerns Carew and Cheke—but also another
more momentous matter, and perhaps the one communicated
to me heretofore [and written to the Doge in a despatch now
lost] relating to the Lady Elizabeth, which proceeds with
very great secrecy.”<a name="FNanchor_609_609"
id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
Again he says that the arrest of Carew
and Cheke has been followed by that of Lord Thomas Howard
(second son of the third Duke of Norfolk) who has been suspected
for some time, on account of his intimacy with three
of the conspirators, and he then communicates the following
important fact: “The French ambassador, M. de Noailles, took
leave of the Queen yesterday, as for many months; subsequent
however to the discovery of the conspiracy, he has most
earnestly requested his king to recall him hence, for the removal
simultaneously of the suspicions and accusations to
which he will be hourly subjected, through the examinations
of the conspirators, and to avoid any dishonour, from which
he has indeed had a very narrow escape, for from what I
hear, there was a debate and decision in the Privy Council,
as to whether, by proceeding against him individually, as a
plotter and contriver against the state and person of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
Sovereign with whom he resides, the ‘<i>jus gentium</i>’ would thus
be violated; but to avoid coming to open hostilities at the
present moment, and under existing circumstances, it seems
that the ministry has not chosen to proceed further, dissembling
their indignation, and consigning the affair to silence
for the present, perhaps in conformity with the will and command
of the most Serene King. There will remain here in
his stead as agent, a brother of his, a Councillor of the Parliament
of Bordeaux, who was sent lately from France, until the
arrival of the other brother, the Protonotary, destined a long
while ago for the embassy in ordinary.”<a name="FNanchor_610_610"
id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>The arrest of Lord Thomas Howard was followed by that
of Lord de la Warre, described by Michiel as “factious and
scandalous, having been deprived of his seat in Parliament as
baron, for an attempt to poison one of his uncles, for the sake
of inheriting from him so much the sooner, wherefore no one is
surprised at his having been guilty as an associate in the plot”.<a name="FNanchor_611_611"
id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>
About the same time were sent to the Tower the notorious
Katharine Ashley, governess of Elizabeth’s household at Hatfield,
and three other inmates of it. They all confessed to
having had knowledge of the conspiracy, this alone being
sufficient to imperil their lives, while in Katharine Ashley’s
possession were found a number of “those writings and scandalous
books against the King and Queen, which were scattered
about some months ago, and published all over the kingdom”.</p>

<p>It was probably owing to Philip’s prudent policy that
Elizabeth’s household and not the Princess herself was accused.
Experience had proved, that to push matters to a crisis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
with Elizabeth was wholly unprofitable, and that by giving her
an opportunity of placing herself in the light of a victim, the
enemy’s hands were strengthened. Philip, far more diplomatic
than the Queen, had on the few occasions on which he had
come into personal contact with her, affected to regard her as
a friend. And he had seen the futility of any other attitude
towards her. Moreover, he was still hoping that Parliament
would grant him the crown matrimonial, and he was mindful of
those members of the opposition, of whom the Queen had told
him that they were in so great force, all devoted to Elizabeth,
and who might yet turn the balance in his favour. Thus it was
no doubt Philip’s influence that prompted the curious proceedings
towards her, related in Michiel’s letter of the 9th June:—</p>

<p>“The arrest of the governess, and of Miladi Elizabeth’s
three domestics having subsequently been added to by that
of two other gentlemen resident here, who although her
dependants, and receiving salaries from her are in less constant
attendance on her than the aforesaid, the Queen was induced
to send to her in the country (at Hatfield) yesterday, Sir
Edward Hastings, Master of the Horse, and Sir Henry<a name="FNanchor_612_612"
id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
Englefield, one of the lords of the royal Council, to console
and comfort her on behalf of her Majesty, knowing, as may
well be supposed, that this circumstance had distressed and
dejected her; and to present her as a token of loving salutation,
and of a message of good-will, according to the custom
here, with a ring worth 400 ducats, and also to give her
minute accounts of the cause of their arrest, to acquaint her
with what they had hitherto deposed and confessed, and to
persuade her not to take amiss the removal from about her
person of similar folks, who subjected her to the danger of
some evil suspicion; assuring her of the Queen’s good-will and
disposition, provided she continue to live becomingly, to her
Majesty’s liking; together with some other particulars which
cannot now be ascertained; using in short, loving and gracious
expressions, to show her that she is neither neglected nor
hated, but loved and esteemed by her Majesty. This message
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
is considered most gracious by the whole kingdom, everybody
in general wishing her all ease and honour, and very greatly
regretting any trouble she may incur; the proceedings having
been not only necessary, but profitable to warn her of the
licentious life led, especially in matters of religion, by her
household, independently of the certain knowledge had by
those members of it who have been arrested, of these conspiracies;
she being thus clandestinely exposed to the manifest
risk of infamy and ruin.</p>

<p>“The Queen has thus moreover an opportunity for remodelling
her (Elizabeth’s) household in another form, and
with a different sort of persons to those now in her service,
replacing them by such as are entirely dependent on her
Majesty; so that as her own proceedings, and those of all
such persons as enter or quit her abode will be most narrowly
scanned, she may have reason to keep so much the more to
her duty, and together with her attendants behave the more
cautiously; but on the return of the gentlemen aforesaid, the
effect produced by them will be still better ascertained.”</p>

<p>On the 16th Michiel continues:—</p>

<p>“The office performed with Miladi Elizabeth by the two
personages sent to her in the Queen’s name, agreed with what
I wrote on the 9th, as heard on their return. According to the
chief commission given them; before leaving her, they placed
in her house a certain Sir Thomas Pope, a rich and grave
gentleman of good name, both for conduct and religion; the
Queen having appointed him Miladi’s governor, and she
having accepted him willingly, although he himself did his
utmost to decline such a charge. I am told that besides this
person, they also assigned her a widow gentlewoman as governess,
in lieu of her own, who is a prisoner, so that at present,
having none but the Queen’s dependents about her person, she
herself likewise may be also said to be in ward and custody,
though in such decorous and honourable form as becoming.”<a name="FNanchor_613_613"
id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>Elizabeth shortly afterwards wrote the following letter to
Mary, exceeding in obscurity of phrase and circumlocution
any of her former effusions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I revolve in mind (most noble Queen) the old
love of Painyms to their prince and the reverent fear of the
Romans to their Senate, I can but muse for my part, and
blush for theirs, to see the rebellious hearts and devilish
intents of Christians in names, but Jews indeed toward their
anointed King. Which methinks if they had feared God
though they could not have loved the State, they should for
dread of their own plague have refrained that wickedness
which their bounden duty to your Majesty hath not restrained.
But when I call to remembrance that the devil
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tanquam Leo rugiens circumit querens
que devorare potest</span></i>, I do
the less marvel, though he have gotten such novices into
his professed house, as vessels without God’s grace, more apt
to serve his palace, than might to inhabit English land. I am
the bolder to call them his imps, for that Saint Paul saith
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">seditiosi filii sunt diaboli</span></i>,
and since I have so good a buckler,
I fear the less to enter into their judgment. Of this I assure
your Majesty, though it be my part, above the rest, to bewail
such things, though my name had not been in them, yet it
vexeth me so much that the devil owes me such a hate, as
to put me in any part of his mischievous instigations, whom
as I profess him my foe that is all christians’ enemy, so wish
I he had some other way invented to spite me, but since
it hath pleased God thus to bewray their malice afore they
finish their purpose, I most humbly thank him both that
he hath ever thus preserved your Majesty through his aid,
much like a lamb from the horns of their Basanbulls, and
also stirs up the hearts of your loving subjects to resist them
and deliver you to his honour, and their shame. The intelligence
of which, proceeding from your Majesty, deserveth
more humble thanks than with my pen I can render, which as
infinite I will leave to number. And among earthly things I
chiefly wish this one, that there were as good surgeons for
making anatomies of hearts that might show my thoughts to
your Majesty, as there are expert physicians of the bodies, able
to express the inward griefs of their maladies to their patients.
For then I doubt not, but know well, that whatsoever other
should suggest by malice, yet your Majesty should be sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
by knowledge, so that the more such misty clouds offuscate
the clear light of my truth, the more my tried thoughts should
glister to the dimming of their hid malice. But since wishes
are vain, and desire oft fails, I must crave that my deeds may
supply that my thoughts cannot declare, and they be not
misdeemed there, as the facts have been so well tried. And
like as I have been your faithful subject from the beginning
of your reign, so shall no wicked persons cause me to change
to the end of my life. And thus I commit your Majesty to
God’s tuition, who I beseech long time to preserve, ending with
the new remembrance of my old suit, more for that it should
not be forgotten, than for that I think it not remembered.</p>

August, your Majesty’s obedient subject and humble sister</p>

<p>The truce concluded between Philip and Henry for five
years, made in despite of a treaty scarcely two months old,
between the King of France and the Pope, which had for its
object to drive the Spaniards out of Italy, came to an end in
July of the same year. It was broken by Henry, at the instigation
of the Pope’s envoy and nephew Cardinal Caraffa, who
promised the King of France that his uncle should give the
crown of Naples to one of his sons, and Milan to another.
Philip then declared war against the Pope who imprisoned
his ambassador, and proceeded to the fortification of Rome.
“The Queen,” said Michiel, “by her orders still continues to
maintain her neutrality, although harassed as usual, owing to
the present suspicions between the Pope and her consort, on
account of which, Cardinal Pole was on the point of sending
an express to Rome, but apparently awaits the return of
Francesco Piamontese.”</p>

<p>At home, justice was being administered in a manner that
seemed to promise immunity from further attempts at revolution,
although after events proved, that the evil was still
lurking in Elizabeth’s shadow. Kingston died on his way to
the Tower, of a disease from which he had long been suffering;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
his accomplices were tried and executed, “while all,
both good and bad, said and admitted, that the execution
was just and holy”. The death of Lord de la Warre, and
that of three others condemned with him, was deferred from
day to day, in order, said Michiel, that they might “reconcile
themselves to God, and for the salvation of their souls, to
which above all the Queen wishes the greatest attention to
be paid, rather than because either they or others may hope
for pardon, as the persons aforesaid, neither by their own
deserts, nor through the intercession of persons in great
favour with the Queen, and very dear to her, have been able
to obtain it. According to report, although it seems improbable,
Carew will adjust his affairs by payment of a fine, some
persons telling me that he has already done so, by agreeing to
disburse £2,000 sterling. Cheke has again demanded a conference
with the theologians, after having lately dismissed them,
persisting obstinately in his heretical opinions, which unless he
retract them will cause him likewise to be burned in public.”<a name="FNanchor_615_615"
id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th October, the ambassador announced that
Peter Carew had come out of the Tower, and was released
entirely, after having compounded for 2,000 marks, and had
already paid a part of his debt to the Crown. Katharine
Ashley was also set at liberty, but was deprived of her office
in Elizabeth’s household, “and forbidden ever again to go to
her ladyship,” who was expected shortly at court. Dr. Cheke
recanted and was liberated. As a direct consequence of his
recantation, “through the efficacy of his language,” about
thirty others followed his example and saved their lives.<a name="FNanchor_616_616"

He died the next year, some said of remorse, for what he had
done against the reformed religion.</p>

<p>The times were more full of strife and trouble for Mary
than any period she had traversed since the beginning of her
reign. Her confidence in her people, which had carried her
undoubtingly through the anxieties of Wyatt’s rebellion, had
been rudely shaken. Insult, calumny and treachery had at
last opened her eyes to the extent of the disaffection that
prevailed. Philip, moreover, who was to have been her sheet-anchor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
and that of the nation, treated her not merely with
neglect, but with ill-disguised contempt; and far from appreciating
the difficulties and dangers with which she was beset,
added to them, by insisting on concessions that could only be
wrung from the nation at the cost of the last remnant of her
popularity. Together with him, she had celebrated with inexpressible
joy, what was to have been the crowning glory of her
reign—the reconciliation of her kingdom with the Holy See—and
now, little more than a year and a half afterwards, not
only was the country a very hot-bed of political and religious
revolt, but the most Catholic King himself was in open debate
with the Pope, and even threatened with excommunication.
She had reason enough to acknowledge herself beaten all
along the line, but she would have been no Tudor had she
done so. As for her constancy, no other Tudor could boast
the like, and little as Philip cared for her, she clung to him as
faithfully as to the principles that had been her mainstay all
her life long. Her piteous plight did not escape the observation
of the kindly Venetian ambassador, who in his despatch
of the 23rd June, 1556, wrote: “As for many months, the Queen
has passed from one sorrow to another, your Serenity can
imagine what a life she leads, comforting herself as usual with
the presence of Cardinal Pole, to whose assiduous toil and
diligence, having entrusted the whole government of the kingdom,
she is intent on enduring her troubles as patiently as
she can”. Two months later, he wrote: “To say the truth,
the Queen’s face has lost flesh greatly since I was last with
her, the extreme need she has of her Consort’s presence harassing
her, as told me, she having also within the last few days
lost her sleep”. And again: “The Queen has been unwell
lately, both from the great heat, the like of which no one
remembers, as likewise owing to some mental vexation, and
not having yet quite recovered, she has chosen to change her
residence, and to-day went eight miles hence to Croydon, to
a house of the most illustrious the Legate”.<a name="FNanchor_617_617"
id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span> “Before moving,”
said Michiel in another letter, “the Queen chose to give
orders and arrange about the prisoners, so as not to be troubled
with this business during her absence, having some of them
released, on giving security, others being fined, others remaining
in prison where they were; to others she conceded liberty
within the Tower; and the execution of those condemned to
death is deferred from what I hear, until her return, perhaps
in order that the King being then here may, with his usual
clemency, obtain their entire release, so as to gain for himself
so much the more favour and popularity.”<a name="FNanchor_618_618"
id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the Queen’s resolve to treat the peace disturbers
with greater severity than heretofore, her former leniency having
been so much abused, it does not appear from the above
that Mary had any desire for their death, but it would seem
rather, as if she snatched at every pretext for sparing their
lives, providing them with every possible pretext for escape.
In her desolation and perplexities, she turned more than ever
to the consolations of religion, and to the relief of the poor and
afflicted. It was especially to the summer of 1556, part of
which was spent at Croydon, that the biographer of the
Duchess of Feria refers, when he describes Mary’s informal
visits to her poor neighbours, and tells of the practical aid
and sympathy the Queen gave them in their necessities,
listening to their grievances, taking their part actively on
occasion, against the injustice of her own officials, advising
them as to the upbringing of their children, and doing all
she could to improve their condition.<a name="FNanchor_619_619"
id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
But it was not only
during her retirement in the country, that she found time for
acts of charity. In the midst of the cares of state, and the
turmoil of public affairs, devotion to the poor was among the
recognised duties of her daily life. It was part of her personal
piety, and inseparable from her devotion to her religion, the
sincerity of which, notwithstanding all the libels that have
been heaped upon her memory, has never been called in
question.</p>

<p>In Holy Week, 1556, the Dudley conspiracy had just been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
discovered, and the Queen was too much alarmed to allow
of Cardinal Pole’s departure for Canterbury. From the
despatches of the Venetian ambassador we know that she
refrained for some time almost entirely from appearing in
public, yet she made no alteration in the performance of the
public acts of charity, which according to ancient custom she
had determined to carry out at this time. Marc Antonio
Faitta, secretary to Cardinal Pole, writing to a private friend
in Italy, describes the ceremony of the feet-washing on Holy
Thursday by the Queen. He says:—</p>

<p>“Her Majesty, being accompanied by the right reverend
Legate and by the Council, entered a large hall, at the head of
which was my Lord Bishop of Ely, as Dean of the Queen’s
chaplains, with the choristers of her Majesty’s chapel. Around
this hall on either side, there were seated on certain benches
with their feet on stools, many poor women to the number of
forty and one, such being the number of years of the most
Serene Queen. Then one of the menials of the court, having
washed the right foot of each of these poor persons, and this
function being also next performed by the under almoner, and
also by the grand almoner, who is the Bishop of Chichester,
her Majesty next commenced the ceremony in the following
manner: At the entrance of the hall, there was a great number
of the chief dames and noble ladies of the court, and they
prepared themselves by putting on a long linen apron which
reached to the ground, and round their necks they placed
a towel, the two ends of which remained pendant at full length
on either side, each of them carrying a silver ewer, and they
had flowers in their hands, the Queen also being arrayed in
like manner. Her Majesty knelt down on both her knees
before the first of the poor women, and taking in the left hand
the woman’s right foot, she washed it with her own right hand,
drying it very thoroughly with the towel which hung at her
neck, and having signed it with the cross, she kissed the foot
so fervently, that it seemed as if she were embracing something
very precious. She did the like by all and each of the other
poor women, one by one, each of the ladies, her attendants,
giving her in turn their basin and ewer and towel; and I vow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
to you, that in all her movements and gestures, and by her
manner, she seemed to act thus not merely out of ceremony
but from great feeling and devotion. Amongst these demonstrations,
there was this one remarkable, that in washing
the feet, she went the whole length of that long hall, from one
end to the other on her knees. Having finished, and risen on
her feet, she went back to the head of the hall, and commenced
giving in turn to each of the poor women a large wooden
platter, with enough food for four persons, filled with great
pieces of salted fish, and two large loaves, and thus she went
a second time, distributing these alms. She next returned
a third time to begin again, giving to each of the women a
wooden bowl filled with wine, or rather I think hippocras;
after which, for the fourth time, she returned, and gave to each
of these poor people a piece of cloth, of royal mixture, for
clothing. Then returning for the fifth time, she gave to each
a pair of shoes and stockings; for the sixth time she gave to
each a leathern purse, containing forty-one pennies, according
to the number of her own years, and which in value may
amount to rather more than half an Italian golden crown;
finally, going back for the seventh time, she distributed all
the aprons and towels which had been carried by those dames
and noble ladies, in number forty-one, giving each with her
own hand. Her Majesty then quitted the hall, to take off
the gown which she had worn, and half an hour afterwards
she returned, being preceded by an attendant, carrying the
said gown, and thus she went twice round the hall, examining
very closely all the poor women one by one, and then returning
for the third time, she gave the said gown to the one who
was in fact the poorest and most aged of them all; and this
gown was of the finest purple cloth lined with marten’s fur,
and with sleeves so long and wide that they reached the
ground. During this ceremony, the choristers chanted the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</span></i>, with certain
other psalms, reciting at each verse the
words: ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In diebus illis mulier
quæ erat in civitate peccatrix</span></i>’.”<a name="FNanchor_620_620"
id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span></p>
<p>The same writer goes on to describe the ceremonies of
Good Friday:—</p>

<p>“After this, on Friday morning (4th April) the offertory
was performed according to custom in the church of the
Franciscan Friars, which is contiguous to the palace. After
the Passion, the Queen came down from her oratory for the
adoration of the Cross, accompanied by my Lord the right
reverend Legate, and kneeling at a short distance from the
cross, moved towards it on her knees, praying before it thrice,
and then she drew nigh and kissed it, performing this act
with such devotion, as greatly to edify all those who were
present. Her Majesty next gave her benediction to the rings
(cramp rings), the mode of doing so being as follows:<a name="FNanchor_621_621"
id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> An
enclosure was formed for her Majesty, to the right of the high
altar, by means of four benches placed so as to form a square,
into the centre of which she again came down from her oratory,
and placing herself on her knees within this enclosure, two
large covered basins were brought to her, filled with rings of
gold and silver, one of these basins containing rings of her
own, whilst the other had those of private individuals labelled
with their owners’ names. On their being uncovered, she commenced
reciting a certain prayer and psalms, and then taking
them in her two hands, she passed them again and again from
one hand to the other, saying another prayer which commenced
thus: ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sanctifica, Domine, annulos istos</span></i>’.</p>

<p>“This being terminated, her Majesty went to bless the
scrofulous, but she chose to perform this act privately in a
gallery, where there were not above twenty persons; and an
altar being raised there, she knelt and recited the Confession
(Confiteor?), on the conclusion of which, her Majesty turned
towards my right reverend Lord, the Legate, who gave her
absolution; whereupon, a priest read from the Gospel according
to St. Mark, and on his coming to these words:
‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Super ægros manus imponet et bene habebunt</span></i>,’ she caused
one of those infirm women to be brought to her, and kneeling
the whole time, she commenced pressing with her hands in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
the form of a cross, on the spot where the sore was, with such
compassion and devotion, as to be a marvel, and whilst she
continued doing this to a man and to three women, the priest
kept ever repeating these words, ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Super
ægros</span></i>,’ etc. Then
on terminating the Gospel, after the words ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In principio erat
verbum</span></i>,’ and on coming to the following, namely, ‘<i><span
lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erat lux
vera quæ illuminat omnem hominem in hunc mundum</span></i>,’ then
the Queen made the sick people again approach her, and
taking a golden coin called an angel, she touched the place
where the evil showed itself, and signed it with this coin
in the form of the cross; and having done this, she passed a
ribbon through a hole which had been pierced in the coin, and
placed one of these round the neck of each of the patients,
making them promise never to part with that coin, which
was hallowed, save in case of extreme need, and then, having
washed her hands, the towel being presented to her by my
Lord the right reverend Legate, she returned to her oratory.</p>

<p>“Having been present myself in person at all these ceremonies,
her Majesty struck me as affording a great and rare
example of goodness, performing all those acts with such
humility and love of religion, offering up her prayers to God
with so great devotion and affection, and enduring for so
long a while and so patiently so much fatigue; and seeing
thus, that the more her Majesty advances in the rule of this
kingdom, so does she daily afford fresh and greater opportunities
for commending her extreme piety, I dare assert
that there never was a queen in Christendom of greater
goodness than this one, whom I pray God long to save and
prosper, for the glory of His divine honor, and for the
edification and exaltation of His holy Church, not less than
for the consolation and salvation of the people of this island.”<a name="FNanchor_622_622"
id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p>Faitta adds that at court, alms were distributed to 3,000
poor persons on Holy Thursday, and that the Cardinal having
made preparations for his public entry into his archdiocese,
and being prevented by the Queen from going there, caused
all his provisions to be divided among the poor of Canterbury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
2,000 in number, besides giving largesses to many others, who
had flocked to that city from the neighbourhood, “all which
causes the indigent population there now to await his right
reverend Lordship with greater anxiety than ever”.</p>

<p>Another source of consolation to Mary, during Philip’s
prolonged absence, lay in the success of her plans for the
re-establishment of the religious orders, which had been dispersed,
and their homes for the most part secularised by her
father. Her health had been greatly benefited by her sojourn
at Croydon, she took fresh heart at her husband’s renewed
promises of a speedy return, and entering London at the
approach of Michaelmas, seemed to have recovered her usual
spirits. Michiel wrote on the 28th September: “The Queen,
thank God, continues in her good plight, rejoicing to see
the monks of St. Benedict returned to their old Abbey of
Westminster, into which, the canons having been removed,
they, in God’s name, will make their entry to-morrow,<a name="FNanchor_623_623"
id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> and
this will be the third monastery and order of regulars, besides
one of nuns which has been hitherto reestablished, to which
will be soon added the fourth, of the Carthusians (at Shene)
who have already made their appearance, to return as they
will, according to the promise given them, to their ancient
abode, eight miles hence, although it is now occupied by the
Duchess of Somerset, who is however to be recompensed with
something else”.<a name="FNanchor_624_624"
id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>On the 24th October, Michiel announced the arrival at
Dover of the King’s pages, stable and armoury, together with
some shopkeepers “who follow the Court, to put their shops
in order” against his Majesty’s arrival, “and as this” said he,
”is the first sign witnessed, it has greatly rejoiced this entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
city, and the people, chiefly on account of the profit which
from past experience they all hope to make”. A report
was also circulated, of an agreement arrived at between the
Pope and King Philip, to the great rejoicing of the Queen
and of Cardinal Pole. “Nothing is thought of, nothing
expected save this blessed return of the King,” wrote the
Venetian on the 24th November, “which as told me by
Cardinal Pole, the Queen will not credit can be impeded or
delayed by the rupture in Italy with the Pope, unless here
they declare war on France; but as yesterday, a courier sent
express post haste brought news of the King’s return to
Brussels, thus removing himself to a greater distance from
here, everybody’s suspicion of further delay has increased....
Here, they have been intent on levying the loan demanded
by them; henceforth they will occupy themselves by paying
the debts, the Queen choosing everybody to be satisfied by
Christmas or before, and to give yet greater satisfaction, she
has also willed that the gentlemen pensioners and yeomen,
who were broken lately, re-enter her service, letting it appear
that their dismissal proceeded from her councillors, and not
from her own desire, which by the said pensioners and universally
was received with twofold gratitude.”</p>

<p>On the 9th November, Philip told Mary that he could
not fix a certain date for his return, but that he hoped it
would be soon, “and though this indeed saddens the Queen,”
said Michiel, “yet nevertheless, considering that such is the
fact, and that his not coming does not proceed from neglect,
nor from little will, but from necessity, owing to the nature
of the times, and his important business, the Queen has of
late been pacified, and hope remaining to her, she endures
this delay better than she did”.<a name="FNanchor_625_625"

other, as she had in fact shown but little conjugal affection for him, and that
little could be hoped from her; they also said that not only had the King to pay
his own expenses, but also those of a great number of Englishmen, spending
so vast a sum of money, and being subjected to so many vexations in that
kingdom, on account of the Queen, that were he not bound by this marriage,
the imperial and royal courtiers said generally, he ought to be deterred from

<p><span class="smcap">Want</span> of money had hampered the Queen from the beginning
of her reign, and was not the least among the causes which
led to the unpopularity of her government. Her poverty
was apparent, had observed the French ambassador, even in
the number of dishes placed on her table, and worse still,
it had necessarily influenced the distribution of rewards to
those who had risked all for their rightful sovereign. One
not unfriendly ambassador so far misunderstood the state of
her finances, as to accuse her of parsimony, although it was
well known that she had inherited debts from her father and
brother, amounting to an enormous sum.<a name="FNanchor_626_626"
id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>The Act of Parliament which restored Papal supremacy
also decreed that the holders of Church lands might lawfully
retain them, the Kings of England having had jurisdiction
over all ecclesiastical property from time immemorial. Mary’s
own conscience refused to be quieted by an Act of Parliament,
and in November 1555, the tenths and first-fruits which
Henry had seized, and Edward had kept were restored to the
Church, together with the value of each ecclesiastical benefice
and the first year’s income of each, worth about a million
a year of present day money.<a name="FNanchor_627_627"
id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
This strain on her already
impoverished exchequer was immense, but in vain her ministers
objected that the money was sorely needed to support
the dignity of the Crown, the Queen replied characteristically,
“I would rather lose ten such crowns, than place my soul in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
peril”.<a name="FNanchor_628_628"
id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
Gardiner pledged himself to secure the consent of
Parliament to this renunciation, but his death prevented him,
and Mary herself sent for a deputation from each House,
explained her desire, and the reasons which moved her to
restore the Church property vested in the Crown. A bill was
accordingly drawn up. It passed through the Upper House
with only two dissentient voices, and was carried in the
Commons by a majority of 193, against 126 votes. The
money thus restored to its original purpose was placed at the
disposal of Cardinal Pole, to be expended on the augmentation
of small livings, on the support of preachers, and on the
foundation of scholarships at the universities.<a name="FNanchor_629_629"
id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>

<p>It has been frequently made to appear, as if the Queen
wished to oblige all holders of ecclesiastical goods to follow
her example, but the contrary is amply demonstrated by
Pole’s correspondence on the subject, contained in St. Mark’s
Library at Venice, and by Mary’s own request to Paul IV.
that he would make no difficulties about restitution.<a name="FNanchor_630_630"
id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a></p>

<p>But having impoverished herself for conscience’ sake, and
being burdened with inherited debts, the Queen was ever
after, in the humiliating position of a suppliant to her people,
whenever a fresh need for funds arose. Philip moreover, who
had at first contributed in a princely fashion, to the revenues
of the country, was engaged in a costly war, while the subsidies
which he had received from Spain were pawned in
perpetuity, those of Milan alienated for five years, those of
Naples for seven, and the means of finding money elsewhere
scanty.<a name="FNanchor_631_631"
id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
The English had persistently refused to crown him,
and Mary had apparently been unable to force them to do so;
she must prove her wifely devotion by raising money for his
wars, in which case he would gratify her by going to visit her.</p>

<p>The new loan subscribed by Parliament, in consequence
of Gardiner’s representations, was being raised with great
difficulty, thanks to de Noailles’ manipulation of the opposing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
members, although Mary had demanded less than the original
sum voted. A fresh device must therefore be invented if
Philip’s wants were to be met. The plan adopted is described
by Michiel as unusual, even unprecedented.</p>

<p>“The Queen,” he wrote on the 25th August 1556, “sent
freely to the lords and gentlemen, the wealthiest and best provided,
letters in which is specified the precise sum demanded
of each of them, according to what the individual might be
supposed able to bear, and I am told that the least is £40
sterling, her Majesty urging all of them to exceed their means,
availing themselves of their property and credit to raise the
sum required by her, as she is in great need, and compelled
to supply herself with funds to enable her to quell the insurrections
to which she is daily subjected. This mode of
request has seemed the more strange and vexatious to everybody
as it is unusual and unprecedented, the device being
attributed to the Spanish lords, in order as said by them
publicly, that the King may make use of the money; so it
seems that all (although it be untrue) apologise, under pretence
of being overwhelmed with debts. But opposition will be of
little avail, nor in the end will any one dare obstinately to
resist her Majesty’s desire.”<a name="FNanchor_632_632"
id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a></p>

<p>The general irritation at this measure was increased by
the circumstance, that payment was to be made through the
Queen’s Comptroller, instead of through the Lord High
Treasurer, through a private instead of a public official. But
none were taxed over £100, the lowest sum demanded being
£20. Mary told Philip of the great difficulty she experienced
in getting the tax paid, and of the loud complaints and foul
language current on this account, it being understood that
she was either giving him the money, or making use of it to
further the design attributed to the Emperor of going to
England, of crowning his son by force, and of putting pressure
on Parliament to wage war on France, “which,” adds Badoer,
“it does not seem inclined to do”. In the same despatch,
Badoer says that Piamontese had told him, that the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
had again written very earnestly to the Pope, “not only to
pray and exhort him to abstain from disturbing his Majesty’s
affairs, but to let him know that the people of England
from this cause are greatly encouraged to resume Lutheran
opinions”.</p>

<p>Philip, seeing that his affairs in England showed little
sign of progressing in his absence, made a virtue of necessity,
and rejoiced the Queen, by declaring that he would set out as
soon as possible, after the pending departure of the Emperor
for Spain. Mary received the news in a transport of delight,
but Pole, who had learned to distrust Philip’s repeated assurances
of his speedy arrival, persuaded her to await further
intelligence, before despatching Pembroke, Arundel and Paget
to the sea coast. He could not dispel the renewed hope
which sent her back to London at Michaelmas, in better
health and spirits than for months before. She took her
barge at Lambeth, but before crossing to St. James’s Palace
expressed a desire to visit the Cardinal’s official residence,
and “not only chose to enter it, but ascending the stairs, had
herself conducted by his most illustrious Lordship into his
own chamber, and through the gardens everywhere, staying
for luncheon, with infinite familiarity and kindness, asking
two or three times for Monsignor Priuli<a name="FNanchor_633_633"
id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
who failed to present
himself”.</p>

<p>But again Philip’s coming was delayed, and the courier
Piamontese performed wonderful feats of rapid travelling
between Brussels and London, carrying despatches of the
utmost weight and significance. “On Wednesday last,” says
Michiel, writing on the 23rd November, “at one and the same
time, Francesco Piamontese returned from Brussels, and from
France the secretary of the Queen’s ambassador there, both
one and the other having travelled with such speed, that the
one came from Paris to London in 25 hours, and the other
out and home from Brussels (although detained there during
a day and a half) in five days. Since their arrival until now,
the ministers, and Cardinal Pole may be said to have been in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
very close consultation, assembling every day at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> well-nigh
before day break, until the dinner hour, and after noon
until 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> or about the second hour of the night according
to the Italian fashion. This proceeding is unusual, and Lord
Paget having been confined to the house by indisposition, for
upwards of a month, they even urged him, on no account to
absent himself from the Council board, and although he
apologised, as not being in a state to be able to go abroad, I
understand that what he could not do by word of mouth, in
their presence, was done by him in writing, and that he gave
his opinion about what had been asked him at full length.
The speed of the couriers, and these long and extraordinary
consultations, indicate the gravity and importance of the matter
which is being treated so secretly, that as yet, no one has
been able to elicit anything certain about it, although from
conjecture and conversation rather than from knowledge,
many things have been, and still continue to be said, some
persons declaring, that some fresh conspiracy, in virtue of an
understanding with the French, has been discovered, or some
design of the French themselves, on certain places either here
or across the Channel. Others, on the contrary, believe the
business to be some request from the King to the Queen, to
the effect that should the truce be broken, as is feared, war be
also waged by England against France, and if this cannot or
will not be done, that at least a subsidy of money or troops
be given, by reason of the great preparations of the French
for Italy, and all the borders; but be it as it may, the deliberation
proceeds so silently, that to know anything more about
it is difficult. It has been determined for the Earl of Pembroke
to cross the Channel, and in two days he will go to
Calais, nor is it known whether he is betaking himself to the
King. He has ordered his whole household to follow, and it
is said that from suspicion, all the guards will be changed.”<a name="FNanchor_634_634"
id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st December, Michiel informed his government
that he had discovered Lord Pembroke’s going to Calais
to be caused by the French having reinforced their cavalry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
on the borders of Calais and Guisnes, with a view to a fortress
held by the English, named Hammes, the governor of which
was Lord Dudley, brother of the traitor Henry Dudley, then
still in France, and in great favour with the King.<a name="FNanchor_635_635"
id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Continuing
the same despatch, he says:—</p>

<p>“Three days ago, Miladi Elizabeth arrived from the country,
fifteen miles off (from Hatfield) with a handsome retinue,
having with her, including lords and gentlemen, upwards of
200 horsemen, clad in her own livery, and dismounted at her
own house (Somerset Place) where she has remained ever
since, to the infinite pleasure of this entire population, though
she was not met by any of the lords or gentlemen of the
Court, but many visited her subsequently. Three days afterwards,
she went to the Queen, and according to report
was received very graciously and familiarly. Yesterday, she
returned thither to take leave, having at length had an interview
with the Cardinal, whom she visited even in his own
chamber, he never having seen her until then, although last
year, they both resided at the Court for a whole month, with
their apartments very near each other. It cannot yet be ascertained
whether she came for any other purpose than that
of visiting the Queen, she having with great earnestness
solicited to come, and not having been called. With this
opportunity, I (according to the custom of my predecessors)
now that she seems to be in good favour with her Majesty
will not fail to visit her before her departure, not having done
so hitherto. Yesterday, the festival of St. Andrew, in Westminster
Abbey, which has been restored to the monks, the
most illustrious Legate and the royal Council (with all the
lords now here, and the nobility of the Court, I also being
present, with a great concourse of people) celebrated the
anniversary of the kingdom’s release from the schism, which
took place on that day, and the twenty-six monks and their
abbot made a fine show and procession. The Queen likewise
would have been present, had she not been slightly indisposed
during the last three or four days, on which account she has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
not appeared in public, or even in her own chapel at the
palace.”<a name="FNanchor_636_636"
id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p>

<p>A week later, he wrote again: “The Queen still remains
without going abroad, distressing herself about her husband’s
troubles”.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, unfortunately, left London before Michiel had
time to pay his proposed visit to her, and we are consequently
deprived of a description of the Princess at this period, which
his realistic pen would no doubt have rendered extremely
interesting. He was, moreover, recalled by his Government
before the end of the year, and Michiel Surian, who arrived
in England as his successor in March 1557, continued the
official reports of passing events, without, however, the life-like
touches, and vivid colouring of Giovanni Michiel.</p>

<p>At last, it was announced that the King was indeed coming
without further delay. He had set out by the end of the
first week in March, and was met at each important place
through which he passed, by two gentlemen, sent by the
Queen, one of whom returned immediately to Greenwich,
where she awaited her husband’s arrival, to bring her news
of him, and enable her to follow his journey stage by stage.
“Thursday, the 18 day of March,” says Machyn, “the King
landed at Dover, about x of the clock in the night.” His
courtesy and attention to national and local customs were as
apparent as on his first setting foot in England, and having
inadvertently entered Canterbury Cathedral with his spurs on,
he gracefully paid the fine he had thereby incurred, by emptying
his purse full of gold pieces, into the cap of a young

After two days spent in retirement
at Greenwich, Philip rode through London to Whitehall, by
the side of the Queen, who was carried in a litter. He had
no cause to complain of his reception by the citizens, and
he in his turn did his best to please them, by pardoning
and releasing certain prisoners in the Tower, “nevertheless,
from what I hear,” reported Surian, “the Spaniards are so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
greatly hated, that neither his Majesty nor the Queen are
well looked on by the multitude”. On the other hand, all
the members of the Privy Council were his firm friends,
“owing,” said the new Venetian ambassador, “to the great
rewards they have had from him, for when last here, he spent
and gave a considerable quantity of money, and distributed
vast revenues in Spain and Flanders, to propitiate the leading
people here, and he found by experience that what my father
used to say of this kingdom was perfectly true, that all, from
first to last are venal, and do anything for money”.<a name="FNanchor_638_638"
id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<p>He went on to say that the Count de Feria had assured
him, that the King had so much influence with the Council
that he could do with them what he pleased, and that it was
in his Majesty’s power to make the country wage war against
France, when and in what manner he chose. Surian thought
however that Philip would only demand pecuniary help, in
which surmise his shrewdness was at fault. “Thus,” he continued,
”do the affairs of the government proceed at present,
and those of the religion are regulated with less severity,
both to avoid further exasperation of the public mind, as also
because, although few are perhaps really Catholic at heart,
everybody nevertheless, in appearance, makes a show of living
religiously, so there is no cause for proceeding against them.”<a name="FNanchor_639_639"
id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a></p>

<p>Philip’s return, hailed by the Queen and Council, was an
occasion of some embarrassment to Cardinal Pole. On the
one hand, he rejoiced to be free from the burden of secular
affairs, that had weighed so heavily on him, and to be at last
able to attend to his archdiocese; but on the other, his position
as Papal Legate, and as a member of the Sacred College made
it impossible for him to meet on terms of amity, one who was
at war with the Pope. In his official capacity he could not
meet Philip at all, and he sent to excuse himself for not going
to visit him; but before leaving for Canterbury, he went
secretly, unattended, and in his private character, to the King’s
apartments, at which proceeding the French King affected to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
be somewhat scandalised, declaring it to be “an unbecoming
act”. What passed at the interview did not tend to smooth
difficulties with the Pope, or to cause him to listen more
patiently to the Queen’s ceaseless appeals on behalf of her
husband, as the following transcript from a letter of the
Venetian ambassador at the Vatican very well shows. Bernardo
Navagero in describing an audience with Paul IV. on the
8th May 1557, quotes the Pope’s own words: “The Queen’s
ambassador (Sir Edward Carne) who for a native of those
regions is modest and very intelligent, has been to us in the
name of the Queen and of the kingdom, to pray me not to
abandon them, but to remember that it has lately come to
our obedience. We answered him that we love the Queen
for her own sake, as she is good, and has done good works;
for the sake of her mother, who honoured us extremely, when
we were sent to that kingdom by Leo,<a name="FNanchor_640_640"
id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>
and for the sake of
her grandfather, the late Catholic King, to whom we are much
obliged for the love he bore us, and he was assuredly a worthy
King, nor could we ever have believed that his descendants
would have degenerated so much as Charles and Philip; but
we told the Ambassador, that we would willingly separate the
Queen’s cause from that of her—we know not whether to call
him husband, cousin or nephew—and have her as daughter,
bidding her attend to the government of her kingdom, and
not let herself be induced to do anything to our detriment
nor to that of our confederates, as for instance the King of
France, for we would spare neither relations nor friends, but
include in our maledictions and anathemas all those who shall
desert the cause of God. Even yesterday, we had a letter
from the Cardinal of England, telling us that on the arrival
of Philip in London, he departed for his bishopric, and he did
well, for he could not in honour remain there. He says that
he visited King Philip in his own name, as he could not do so
in ours, seeing that he has no commission to that effect, as
we on the contrary have revoked the legations, and recalled
nuncios, and all the ministers of the Apostolic See, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
realms of that individual, to deprive him of the means for
doing injury to God and to us. Cardinal Pole also writes
that the said individual told him, he would gladly be reconciled
to us, and that he has provided for his realms so as to prevent
their molestation. This reconciliation fails through him, as
<i>induratum est cor ejus</i>, and we believe that he will not reform
until his head has been soundly beaten. God knows that for
nothing do we pray Him more earnestly, than for our quiet,
and that of all Christendom, which were He to grant us, we
should close these eyes most contentedly.”<a name="FNanchor_641_641"
id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>But Mary’s most pressing cause for anxiety was Philip’s
determination to invade France, and to prevail on the English,
not only to succour his army with troops and money, but
to consent to an aggressive alliance, and a formal declaration
of war against Henry II. Under other conditions there
would have been nothing repugnant to Mary in an open
rupture with the most Christian King, who from the moment
of her accession had been her secret, powerful and most insidious
enemy. He it was, who by his persistent intrigues
was mainly responsible for the disturbed relations between
herself and her people, and nothing short of honest, open-handed
warfare would get rid of the poison with which he had
inoculated the blood of the nation. Greatly as she loved
peace, and ardently as she had desired it, and striven to
secure it, she knew well that it could be bought at too high
a price. But war with France, in the interest of Spain, would,
it was clear, be extremely unpopular, while it would constitute
an infringement of one of the articles of her marriage treaty
by which Philip undertook not to involve the country in his
personal quarrel with any Continental power. Nevertheless,
he was closeted early and late with the Privy Council,<a name="FNanchor_642_642"
id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> with the
result that Surian informed the Doge and Venetian Senate on
the 21st April, that the hope of peace with the Pope had come
to nothing, and that there was more talk of war than ever.
He went on to say, that no army would be mustered until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
the next harvest was gathered in, for never in memory of man,
had there been such scarcity of everything in England, and
that although for a long while, great supplies of grain had
been coming from Denmark and Sweden, and from the Hanse
towns, these had been stopped by the ice, and as there was
no means of providing for the ordinary consumption of the
people, either in Flanders or England, still less could provision
be made for so great an army as was then being mustered.</p>

<p>As late as the beginning of May, Philip, in spite of his
influence with the Council, had only obtained assurances of
such support as the nation was bound to give him, by ancient
treaties then still existing, as an ally of the House of Burgundy.
He was to have 5,000 infantry, and 1,000 horse for
four months, these to be commanded by the Earl of Pembroke,
Lord Grey, Sir Thomas Cheyne, Lord Warden of the
Cinque Ports, Lord Montague, and some others, “all of whom
were considered good soldiers, except Montagu, who was
appointed because he was rich, and spent willingly on his
troops, who were to serve the King in Flanders”.<a name="FNanchor_643_643"
id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>Besides the above subsidy, 3,000 additional infantry were
to be raised, in order to garrison the English fortresses on the
other side of the Channel, and in case of need, a fleet was to be
fitted out, carrying 6,000 soldiery, half to be paid by Philip, the
other half by England. It was announced that the English
Government had no intention of breaking the peace with
France, the troops being sent to Flanders by virtue of the
old treaty between England and those provinces, and solely
to defend the King’s States, and not to invade France. It was
also pointed out, that the additional 3,000 soldiers were merely
for the defence of Calais and its frontiers, and that the fleet
was to secure the passage of the Channel, and not to attempt
any act of aggression.<a name="FNanchor_644_644"
id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span></p>

<p>Possibly no more than this may have been intended, in
spite of Philip’s demands, but the French believing or affecting
to believe that a rupture was imminent, reinforced all their
places on the English frontier, with ammunition, victuals and
soldiers. They also sent a force to Scotland, sufficient not
only for the defence of the Scottish border, but capable of
attacking England on that side.<a name="FNanchor_645_645"
id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
Even then the actual breaking
out of war with England was due to a renewal of Henry’s
connivance with English traitors and rebels. Dudley and
his friends, among whom was Thomas Stafford, grandson of
the last Duke of Buckingham, had been quietly waiting in
France, till it should be convenient for the King to employ
them, and the moment having now arrived, he entered into
negotiations with them, and with certain families of the reformed
faith, settled in and about Calais, for delivering the
English fortresses, Hammes and Guisnes, into the hands of
the French.<a name="FNanchor_646_646"
id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
The design failed, but a few days later, another,
not less daring, was attempted by Stafford. Having obtained
two French ships, he sailed for England, with a handful of
English, Scotch and French desperadoes, about 100 in all,
and landing on the coast of Yorkshire, seized Scarborough
Castle. He issued a proclamation, assuming the titles of protector
and governor of the realm, and declared that he was
come to deliver his countrymen from the tyranny of strangers
and “to defeat the most devilish devices of Mary, unrightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
and unworthy queen”. She had, he pretended, forfeited her
claim to the sceptre by her marriage with a Spaniard, who
lavished the national treasures on his countrymen, and was
resolved to deliver into their hands twelve of the strongest fortresses
of the kingdom. As for himself, he was determined to die
bravely in the field, rather than see his country enslaved; and
he called on all loyal Englishmen to rally round the standard
of independence which he had set up, and to fight for the
preservation of their lives, lands, wives, children and treasures.<a name="FNanchor_647_647"
id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p>

<p>To his mortification, not a man answered the summons—the
north was more loyal than the traitors suspected, and
Wotton, Mary’s ambassador in France, disclosed the plot
before Henry had time to send aid to his confederates. The
Earl of Westmorland marched to Scarborough with a considerable
force, and Stafford, whose language had been so
bold, at once surrendered at discretion, and met with the
punishment he richly deserved, together with about twenty-five
other persons implicated in the affair.<a name="FNanchor_648_648"
id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span></p>

<p>The only result of the enterprise was, that instead of engaging
in the war with France, as an ally of Philip, England
was now a principal in the quarrel, the Council having resolved
that the time had come for demanding satisfaction for the
injuries offered to Mary by the King of France.<a name="FNanchor_649_649"
id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> Nevertheless,
when on the 7th June 1557, the English herald announced the
declaration of war to Henry, he replied: “I foresaw this war; it
is the pledge of the Queen of England’s submission to the will
of her husband.”<a name="FNanchor_650_650"
id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
He immediately recalled his ambassador,
François de Noailles, Bishop of Acqs, who had replaced his
brother Antoine; but Mary had already dismissed him herself.<a name="FNanchor_651_651"
id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>
The Bishop took the opportunity at Calais, to examine the
state of the fortifications, and the likelihood of its withstanding
a bombardment. The result of his investigation was a report
to the French King, to the effect that a considerable portion
of the rampart lay in ruins, and that the boasted strength
of the place consisted only in its reputation. In its present
condition it offered, said the ambassador, seconded by the
Governor of Boulogne, an easy conquest to a sudden and unexpected
assailant.<a name="FNanchor_652_652"
id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>
“Here, in the meanwhile,” wrote Surian
on the 1st June, “they are expecting the succours from Spain
which do not make their appearance, and unless they be
speedy and considerable, they will show by experience what
a gross blunder it is to circulate reports of making great
preparations, and not verifying them by facts, as it merely
rouses the enemy, rendering them more and more ready for
attack and defence.” But before concluding his despatch, he
adds, “whilst writing this I hear that the Admiral of England
has put to sea with his fleet, in order to meet the one expected
from Spain. He has a total of twenty-three large ships well
supplied with artillery and soldiers; so the French fleet being
greatly inferior in the number and quality of its vessels, and
in the activity of its sailors, and in strength, will be unable to
show itself, and do any damage in these seas.”<a name="FNanchor_653_653"
id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<p>Philip, who had not been five months in England, re-embarked
for Flanders, on the 3rd July. Mary accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
him as far as Dover, and there took leave of him in a heartrending
farewell. They never met again.</p>

<p>Surian had been appointed ambassador to Philip, and
therefore left England with him; and in spite of Mary’s
representations to the Signory, there was afterwards no
resident Venetian envoy in England, Surian doing duty to
both King and Queen.</p>

<p>The first important feature in the new campaign was the
victory of St. Quentin, which was taken by storm by the
Spaniards, aided by Lord Pembroke, and between 7,000 and
8,000 English soldiers. When the news reached London “was
<i>Te Deum laudamus</i> sung and ringing solemnly; at night bonfires
and drinking in every street in London, thanking be to
God Almighty that gives the victory”.<a name="FNanchor_654_654"
id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
Cardinal Pole, in congratulating
Philip, said, “The most serene Queen has also
evinced great gladness at this, principally from the testimony
offered by your Majesty on this occasion, of your piety, to the
glory of God and to His true honour, especially because it
took place with so little loss of life, which grace she always
prays His divine Majesty to grant you in all your victories.
Here, we are anxiously expecting news of some good agreement
with his Holiness, which may our Lord God deign to
grant, and ever have your Majesty in His keeping, and for
His service favour your Majesty, whose hand I humbly kiss.”<a name="FNanchor_655_655"
id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<p>The victory of St. Quentin did actually lead, as Pole so
ardently desired, to peace with the Pope, but also indirectly
to the loss of Calais. A brief survey of Philip’s war with
Paul IV. will make this clear. Philip had always repudiated
any other intention, in carrying on hostilities against the
Pope, than that of protecting the kingdom of Naples against
molestation.<a name="FNanchor_656_656"
id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
The campaign opened by the seizure, in September
1556, of Pontecorvo, and several other small towns in
the Papal States, by the Duke of Alva, Philip’s celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
general. A truce was concluded for forty days, under the
walls of Ostia, and Alva entered Naples in triumph. In the
meantime, the French army, under the Duke of Guise, had
marched into Italy, and had joined hands with the Pope.
The truce having expired, and the two armies being encamped
within a few miles of each other, before Civitella, Guise judged
that Alva’s force was too overwhelming for him to risk a
battle, and retreated, leaving the kingdom of Naples to the
Spaniards. The Pope, alarmed by the success of the Colonnas,
who were fighting on the Spanish side, summoned the Duke
of Guise to Rome, to defend the Holy City. But misunderstandings
arose daily between the Pope and his French allies.
He evinced a great desire for peace, and the Florentine ambassador
sent an express to his Duke, urging him to exhort
the King of Spain to adjust matters with his Holiness, by
giving him some satisfaction before the world, “the old man
desiring nothing else”.<a name="FNanchor_657_657"
id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>
At this juncture, Philip won the
battle of St. Quentin, and took the town by storm, upon
which the King of France, seeing that he would need all the
strength he could muster, to oppose the Spaniards and English
combined, recalled Guise from Italy, and the Pope was obliged
to come to terms with Alva. Escorted by the Papal guard,
Philip’s <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">generalissimo</span></i>
entered Rome on the 27th September
1557, and on reaching the Vatican, fell on his knees before the
Pope and craved his pardon for the offence of having borne
arms against the Church, his master having already declared,
and probably with truth, that he would never have commenced
hostilities, could he have secured his kingdom of Naples by
any other means.</p>

<p>The Duke of Guise was now free to oppose Philip’s inroads
into France. By the month of October, Philip had
three French fortresses in his possession, namely, St. Quentin,
Hammes and Catelet; and Henry’s plan was to harass him
in as many quarters as possible, in the hope that being obliged
to divide his forces, he would be inferior to his enemy in each
one of them. His further design was to hamper Mary, and
prevent her from sending reinforcements across the Channel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
With this object the French King despatched 10,000 infantry-men,
and a company of horse to the Queen Regent of Scotland,
who hereupon entered Berwick-on-Tweed, and occupied it, at
the same time ravaging the Borders.</p>

<p>Flattering himself that Henry would disband, in face of
the rigorous winter, Philip returned to Brussels, convoked
the States, and required them to levy a subsidy in money, for
carrying on the war in the spring. The utmost that could be
obtained from them was 800,000 crowns, far too small a sum
for maintaining his troops, and defending his conquered fortresses
in the midst of an enemy’s country.</p>

<p>If the victory of St. Quentin was the principal feature of
the first campaign, the loss of Calais marked the second with
disaster. The first note of alarm came from England, in a
letter from Cardinal Pole to the King, dated the 4th January
1558. It proved not only the prelude to worse news, but
testified to the spirit in which Mary was prepared to meet
the crowning calamity of her life.</p>

<p>“Although I wrote to your Majesty yesterday, in reply to
what you were pleased to write to me on the 24th ultimo,
yet nevertheless having heard to-day of the loss of Risbank
near Calais (taken on the 3rd) I will not omit telling you how
in an untoward circumstance, the most serene Queen has shown
her usual firmness, which has comforted me the more, as I was
at first anxious, lest such unexpected news might seriously
agitate her Majesty, especially as we now hope she is pregnant;
but having seen not only that she was not in the least
disheartened by this news, but that immediately on hearing
it, she commenced arranging and providing by such means as
possible, both divine and human, for what the present need
requires, as also by ordering supplications and prayers to be
made in all the religious congregations for success, I was much
comforted. I have deemed it my duty to give notice of this
to your Majesty, as by your putting forth your vigorous arm
and aid, which we are certain you will do, with such speed
as the present need requires, I have no doubt but that the
Almighty will thus convert everything to His greater glory,
and at the same time to the consolation and honour of your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
Majesties and your realms; as I continually pray His divine
Majesty’s goodness to do, and to preserve and prosper your
Majesty for the common weal, and particularly for this kingdom,
which is placed under your care and government.”<a name="FNanchor_658_658"
id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>

<p>On the same day, Lord Grey de Wilton, Governor of
Guisnes, wrote to the Queen as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My most bounden duty humbly promised to your
Majesty; whereas I have heretofore always in effect written
nothing to your Highness but good, touching the service and
state of your places here, I am now constrained, with woful
heart to signify unto your Majesty these ensuing. The French
have won Newhavenbridge, and thereby entered into all the
Low country, and the marshes between this and Calais. They
have also won Rysbank, whereby they be now master of that
haven. And this last night past, they have placed their
ordnance of battery against Calais, and are encamped upon St.
Peter’s heath before it; so that now I am clean cut off from
all relief and aid, which I looked to have, both out of England
and from Calais, and know not how to have help by any
means, either of man or victuals. There resteth now none
other way for the succour of Calais, and the rest of your
Highness’s places on this side, but a power of men out of
England, or from the King’s Majesty, or from both, without
delay, able to distress and keep them from victuals coming to
them, as well by sea as by land, which shall force them to
levy their siege to the battle, or else drive them to a greater
danger. For lack of men out of England, I shall be forced to
abandon the town, and take in the soldiers thereof, for defence
of the castle. I have made as good provision of victuals as I
could by any means out of the country, with which, God
willing I doubt not to defend and keep this place as long as
any man, whatsoever he be, having no better provision and
furniture of men and victuals than I have; wherein your
Grace shall well perceive, that I will not fail to do the duty of
a faithful subject and Captain, although the enemy attempt
never so stoutly, according to the trust reposed in me. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
addressed letters presently to the King’s Majesty by this
bearer, most humbly desiring aid from him, according to the
effect aforesaid. I might now very evil have spared this
bringer, my servant and trusty officer here in this time of
service. Howbeit, considering the great importance of his
message, I thought him a meet man for the purpose, desiring
your Majesty to credit him fully, and to hear him at large,
even as directly your Grace would hear me, to open my mind
in this complaint of imminent danger. Thus trusting of
relief and comfort forthwith from your Majesty, for the safeguard
of Calais, and other your places here, I take my leave
most humbly of your Grace.</p>

<p>“At your Highness’s Castle of Guisnes, most assured
English, even to the death, the 4th of January 1557 [8] at
seven of the clock in the morning. Your Majesty’s most
humble Servant and obedient Subject,</p>

</p></div>

<p>Lord Wentworth, Deputy Governor of Calais, in the absence
of the Earl of Pembroke, who was collecting troops in
England, had written on the 2nd, that the French were before
Risbank, and that he feared no more of his despatches would
get through, adding, “but I will do what I can tidily to signify
unto your Majesty our state”.<a name="FNanchor_660_660"
id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
Close upon this followed the
news that Risbank had fallen, and Lord Pembroke crossed to
Dunkirk, six leagues from Calais, with 5,000 infantry, hoping
to raise the siege of that place.<a name="FNanchor_661_661"
id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p>In Michiel’s report of England in 1557, the ambassador
describes Calais as having a garrison of 500 of the best
soldiers, besides a troop of fifty horsemen, and as being considered
an impregnable fortress, on account of the inundation
with which it could be surrounded, although certain engineers
doubted that it would prove so, if put to the test. The recent
inspection of the town by the French had led them to the
conclusion that its boasted strength was a fable, and that it
might easily be taken by storm; and their chief reason for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
recalling the Duke of Guise from Italy was probably, that he
might restore this lost jewel to the French Crown.</p>

<p>Michiel, now Venetian ambassador in France, informed
the Doge and Senate on the 4th January, that on presenting
himself before Calais, M. de Guise made himself master of
Risbank, which Michiel describes as “that part of the town
fronting the sea, and which, forming a bank, receives as it
were into an arm or small gulf, the vessels which arrive there,
and which for greater security, withdraw thither under the
walls of the town; and he simultaneously took possession
both of the ships and their crews, and of the hostels which are
built there outside, for the accommodation of the mariners
and wayfarers, so that when they embark or disembark by
night, on account of the tides, they may not have to enter the
town”.<a name="FNanchor_662_662"
id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the ease with which Risbank had been
captured, the first attempt to storm the castle of Calais
proved ineffectual, according to the French account, by reason
of the fluctuation of the tide. The assault being made from
the ships, which at high-tide, were on a level with the town,
but at the ebb below it, the cannon struck at low tide six or
seven paces below the wall, and the besiegers were at the
mercy of the besieged, who from the ramparts made a convenient
target of them. They also threw up earthworks, and
barricades, and fortified the road between the castle and
the town, by placing artillery there. The duke, therefore, returned
to a site above his first position, “Boulogne in his
rear supplying him with provisions,” and a wood not more
than half a league distant affording him plenty of fuel.</p>

<p>From this position, he, two days later, began bombarding
the castle with sixty pieces of artillery, and Michiel observes
that “although the besieged defend themselves stoutly, it is
nevertheless not authentically understood that the garrison is
more numerous than usual, the governor, as said lately by
the King, not having chosen to admit any one; and notwithstanding
a public report, that the Duke of Savoy in person is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
coming to succour the place, with a strong body of cavalry
and infantry, the hope of its capture does not in the least
diminish”.<a name="FNanchor_663_663"
id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>Lord Grey and Lord Wentworth afterwards refuted this
charge, and declared that they sent five messengers to Philip
before the appearance of the French army under Calais, and
never received any reply whatever, which totally disheartened
them, in contradiction of what was said, as to their not having
chosen to accept the garrisons offered to them.<a name="FNanchor_664_664"
id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Philip, however,
cannot reasonably be blamed for the straits to which
the place was reduced. He had never ceased recommending
that Calais should be carefully guarded,<a name="FNanchor_665_665"
id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> and when he heard
that the French were preparing an attack, he insisted that
nothing should be neglected to defeat their projects. His
answer to the appeals of the Governors of Calais and Guisnes
was to commission the Duke of Savoy to levy troops, and
to proceed at once to their aid, but the latter arrived on the
scene too late to avert disaster. Within a week of the assault
a wide breach was made in the castle wall, and seeing that
all was lost, Wentworth ordered the garrison to be withdrawn
and the towers to be blown up, at the approach of the enemy.
That same evening, when the tide was low, a company of
French soldiers waded across the haven, but contrary to
expectation, no explosion occurred, the engineer to whom the
order had been given excusing himself, on the pretext that
the water dropping from the clothes of the Frenchmen, as
they passed over the train, had wetted the powder, rendering
it useless.<a name="FNanchor_666_666"
id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<p>The town itself still remained untaken, but on the 8th
January, news was brought to the French court, that while
the Duke of Guise was preparing to storm it, “one of the
inhabitants appeared on the ramparts with a flag of truce,
praying the besiegers not to fire, nor to proceed to further
hostilities, as the townspeople were willing to surrender; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
whilst it was being treated to have them at discretion, according
to the Duke’s resolve, as he knew that those who remained
were very few and very weak, he having shortly before at the
passes occupied by him, routed four companies of Spaniards
on their march to succour them, they demanding safety for
their properties and persons, he sent Robertet to assure the
King that either at discretion or in some other way, the town
could not fail to be his”.<a name="FNanchor_667_667"
id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>

<p>Eventually, the place surrendered, on condition that the
citizens and garrison should be allowed to depart, with the
exception of Wentworth and fifty others, all the ammunition
and merchandise passing as booty into the hands of the
French. Meanwhile, ample reinforcements of troops and stores
lay waiting at Dover, detained there by stress of weather,
none divining that a place, hitherto deemed impregnable, could
possibly succumb within a week. But the French had contemplated
the enterprise for four years, and the fall of
Boulogne, in the preceding reign, had paved the way for
them to Calais.<a name="FNanchor_668_668"
id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<p>Bonfires were lighted in Paris, two days before the intelligence
that was to plunge England into a stupor of despair
reached London. “The x day of January, heavy news came
to England and London, that the French had won Calais,
the which was the heaviest tidings to London and to England
that ever was heard of, for like a traitor it was sold and
delivered unto them.”<a name="FNanchor_669_669"
id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>“On the 10th, and not previously,” wrote Surian, “the
news of the loss of Calais was received in England, and it
is strange that such important intelligence should scarcely
have been conveyed in three days, whereas the passage
is usually made in one. They (a Spanish and an English
messenger) having left so immediately after the receipt of
the news, are unable to know what took place in the kingdom
either good or bad, merely saying that the Queen, when she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
heard it, determined to make every possible effort to recover
the place, and that besides the ships now ready to put to
sea to succour it, and the troops which were being mustered,
it will be reinforced by the greatest amount the country can
raise, and with the opportunity offered by the session of
Parliament, her Majesty will obtain any sum of money that
may be required to that effect.”<a name="FNanchor_670_670"
id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>Although the English laboured under a delusion in regard
to the strength of Calais, they were probably right in ascribing
its prompt fall to treachery. The whole region had been a
nest of conspirators, of whom Stafford had left many behind
him, when he went to surprise Scarborough Castle, and they
were all in the employ of the King of France. John Highfield
in his letter to Mary, concerning the siege and loss of
Calais, said that the Duke of Savoy had asked him “after
what sort the town was lost”; and he had answered that
“the cause was not only by the weakness of the castle and
lack of men,” but also he thought there was some treason, for
as he heard “there were some escaped out of the town, and
the Frenchmen told [him] that they had intelligence of all
our estate within the town”.<a name="FNanchor_671_671"
id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, Sir Edward Carne wrote from Rome, that tidings
had come from Venice, and from Cardinal Trivulci, Papal
Legate in Paris, “which last stated, that the place had been
rendered without any battery being laid to it, or defence
made, but by appointment of those within it. If so, it is the
most abominable treason that ever man heard of, and most
to be abhorred.”<a name="FNanchor_672_672"
id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a>
In the same despatch, he tells the Queen
that, “if she spares either heretics or traitors, she shall but
nourish fire in her own house”.</p>

<p>The first to break the news to Mary was Cardinal Pole,
who feared the effect it might produce on her. But he
was able to report to Philip that, “in this present case her
Majesty really shows, that in generosity of nature and in
pardoning she is very like herself,” adding politely, “and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
less connected with your Majesties in this respect, than she
is by ties of blood”.<a name="FNanchor_673_673"
id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a>
Nevertheless, while she lived, she
never ceased urging the King and her Council to devise some
means for the recovery of Calais, and grievous as was its
loss to the whole realm, it was remarked that the burden of
sorrow lay most heavily on the Queen herself.<a name="FNanchor_674_674"
id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> She declared
that if her ministers should dare to conclude peace with
France, without stipulating for the restoration of that place,
they should pay for the concession with their heads; and on
her death-bed she assured the bystanders, that if her breast
were opened after death, the word “Calais” would be found
engraven on her heart.<a name="FNanchor_675_675"
id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a></p>

<p>Philip, less ponderous in action than usual, was not slow
to respond to Mary’s appeals, and at once proposed to join
a given number of Spaniards to an equal number of Englishmen,
and to set about the recovery of the town and castle
before the French had time to repair the damages to the
castle walls. As Surian had foretold, money was speedily
forthcoming, the nation being stirred to the quick. The
clergy granted a subsidy of eight shillings in the pound, the
laity one of four shillings on lands, and two and eightpence
on goods, besides a fifteenth and tenth, the whole to be
collected in nine months. Seven thousand men were levied
and trained for service in the field, and a fleet of 140 ships
sailed out of Portsmouth harbour, in the spring. But Philip’s
offer was for various reasons declined, the Queen’s ministers
preferring to fortify the coast of Devonshire against an expected
descent by Dudley, and to send an expedition to
attack the French harbour of Brest, an alternative which
the King had himself proposed, and seconded with a strong
contingent of Flemish troops. The expedition resulted in
failure, but the English Admiral Malin, by supporting the
Count of Egmont, in an engagement with the French, on the
banks of the Aa, gained him a splendid victory. In this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
encounter the French lost 5,000 men, their gallant Marshal de
Fermes and many distinguished officers being taken prisoners.
Peace would then undoubtedly have resulted from the conferences
which took place in the Abbey of Cercamp, between
Philip and Henry, had not the King of Spain felt bound in
honour to make the restoration of Calais an indispensable
condition.</p>

<p>With the fall of Guisnes, three weeks after that of Calais,
England lost for ever her last foothold of territory on the
French side of the Channel. The place was so well defended
“that had the like been done by Calais,” wrote Surian, “that
fortress had never been lost,” and he goes on to say that “Lord
Grey showed incredible valour, for although he had been badly
wounded in the assault, he nevertheless, with very great courage,
stood firm to the defence, until he found himself fainting;
and even then, rather to avoid alarming the soldiers than from
any personal consideration, had himself carried, all bleeding
into a house near at hand; but scarcely had he got there
when he was told that the enemy had taken the ravelin, and
were attacking the bastions; then half dead as he was, he made
his men take him on a chair, to the scene of action, where he
so increased the courage and resolution of the soldiery, that
the French were doubtful of victory; but the assault becoming
more vigorous, Lord Grey seeing that all his men were
worsted,<a name="FNanchor_676_676"
id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
and that there was no remedy, demanded terms, and
it having been granted him, that his soldiers might go out free
with their arms, and what they could carry, he surrendered
himself prisoner, the glory he thus obtained exceeding the
infamy of those who through negligence or treachery lost
Calais, which is close to Guisnes”.<a name="FNanchor_677_677"
id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<p>Lord Grey remained a prisoner in the hands of Prince
Strozzi, by whom he was sold for 8,000 crowns to the Count
de la Rochefoucauld, who had been captured at the battle of
St. Quentin. La Rochefoucauld demanded 25,000 crowns as
Lord Grey’s ransom, a sum which would go a long way to
pay his own ransom of 30,000 crowns. But the money, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
raised, so weakened Lord Grey’s estate, that the hero of
Guisnes was obliged to sell his ancestral castle of Wilton-upon-Wye
to his nephew, Charles Bridges, second son of
John, first Lord Chandos.<a name="FNanchor_678_678"
id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>
The fortress of Hammes fell with
Guisnes, and both places were razed to the ground by the
French.</p>

<p>It would seem that Mary might reasonably have hoped,
whatever her troubles from other sources, to have enjoyed the
favour and confidence of the Roman Pontiff. All her life long,
most of her trials had resulted from an unswerving devotion
to the Holy See, and now the time had come, when she might
expect to reap a rich reward for her faith and fidelity. Julius
III. had sent her the Golden Rose, as an expression of his
affection and esteem, and Paul IV., throughout his differences
with Philip, and however severe his language with reference
to the Catholic King, always disassociated Mary from the
blame which he lavished freely on her consort. Even when
he recalled his representatives, in the length and breadth of
Philip’s dominions, and made no exception of Cardinal Pole,
it was thought that Mary’s protests would procure a speedy
revocation of the decree, so far as it affected her kinsman and
principal adviser. But peace was ultimately made between
Philip and the Holy See, and Pole’s recall as legate
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a latere</span></i>
from a country whose King was at war with the Head of the
Church, was found to be but one aspect of a contest in which
Mary, to her grief and vexation, found herself suddenly involved.</p>

<p>As Cardinal Caraffa, Paul IV. had at one time expressed
doubt as to Pole’s orthodoxy, and although since his elevation
to the Papacy, he had acknowledged that this suspicion had
been unfounded, repeatedly expressing his high opinion of
the English Cardinal, he once more allowed the doubt to gain
possession of his mind. Possibly Pole’s enemies, and the
Queen’s, may have contrived to revive the suspicion for their
own ends—the conspiracy in England was hydra-headed—but
the whole case is enveloped in obscurity, and the only certainty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
is, that when Cardinal Morone was arrested in Rome
on a charge of Lutheranism, Pole was accused of sharing his
friend’s heterodoxy. He defended himself in various letters
to the Pope,<a name="FNanchor_679_679"
id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
and represented that a legate was necessary in
the actual state of affairs in England, although it was immaterial
whether that office were filled by himself or by another.
Mary expostulated directly by letters, and also through her
ambassador in Rome, Sir Edward Carne. Paul replied by
creating Friar Peto, a Cardinal, and giving him the English
legation. Peto had formerly distinguished himself by a firm
and bold adhesion to Queen Katharine’s cause, for which he
had incurred Henry’s anger, and would no doubt have shared
Friar Forest’s fate, had he not fled to the Low Countries. He
was afterwards a chaplain in Cardinal Pole’s household, where
he attracted the attention of the Pope, by the great austerity
of his life. But he was now a very old man, and scarcely fit
for active service, and the appointment caused much surprise
in Rome. In an interview with the English ambassador, Paul
expatiated on the goodness and learning of the new Cardinal,
and said that he hoped what he had done would be agreeable
to her most serene Majesty, and beneficial to the whole kingdom.
Carne replied that, as for Friar Peto personally, he was
willing to believe in his virtue and learning, but that he was
old, and could not bear fatigue, and would merely remain in
his cell praying; and that it would scarcely please the Queen
to have the legation taken away from one so nearly related
to her, and to whom she was so much attached, and to see it
conferred on a decrepit friar, who although he had once confessed
her Majesty,<a name="FNanchor_680_680"
id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
it was only before she had attained her
seventh year. As for benefiting the kingdom, the people,
Carne declared, esteemed no one, who was not of very noble
lineage, or very wealthy, or powerful through armed retainers
and dependent on the Crown; the friar having none of these
prerogatives, no respect would be paid to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Pope only replied to these objections, that he
regretted not being able to do otherwise, as he wished to
have Cardinal Pole in Rome, and to avail himself of his
advice and assistance.<a name="FNanchor_681_681"
id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>No one felt his incompetence for the dignity and office
conferred upon him more than Friar Peto himself, and he
entreated the Pontiff to be allowed to decline them, as too
great a burden for his old and feeble shoulders. In the
meanwhile, Mary wrote that although his Holiness had not
instantly granted her request, she believed that he would do
so, like the Lord, who when entreated more than once, at
length satisfies those who pray to Him heartily. In like
manner, she again prayed and supplicated the Holy Father to
restore the legation in the person of Cardinal Pole, and to
pardon her, if she professed to know the men who were good
for the government of her kingdom, better than the Pope, and
also, if she wondered, that a legate, after being confirmed by
him, and after the performance of so many good works,
whereby it might be truly said, that through him alone
England had resumed her obedience to the Church, should be
recalled without cause. The Queen further protested that
should any disturbance take place in England, it would be on
this account, but that she would do her utmost to prevent it.<a name="FNanchor_682_682"
id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>

<p>This letter Carne delivered to the Pope, whose expression
while reading it, showed extreme exasperation; he also presented
another protest from Friar Peto, and then said that he
besought his Holiness, seeing the Queen’s submission and
reverence for him to be such, as would not have been shown
to him by any other sovereign, that he would be pleased to
grant her demand. After a long silence, the Pope declared
that the matter was one of very great importance, that he
would confer with the Cardinals, and give him a reply.</p>

<p>All that came of this conference was a summons to Pole
to proceed to Rome forthwith, to answer the charges brought
against him by the Inquisition, and a protest from Mary, that
his trial should take place in England, while Peto, invested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
with all the powers hitherto exercised by Pole, was to take his
place at once.</p>

<p>In order not to place herself in open opposition to the
Pope, and yet not to yield in a matter which appeared to her
to involve the most serious consequences, Mary had recourse
to a diplomatic quibble, not unprecedented in history. She
gave orders that every courier from the continent should be
detained, and searched, on his arrival at any English port, and
when the Papal messenger reached Calais, on his way to
England, he was arrested and deprived of his despatches.
In this way, although Mary knew, from private letters, of Peto’s
appointment and of Pole’s recall, she never received the
official notification of either. The Papal brief addressed to
Pole disappeared at the same time, while Peto never received
the bull which appointed him legate. But the Cardinal ceased
to exercise his functions as legate <i>a latere</i>, although he retained
those of <i>legatus natus</i>, which belonged to the Archbishopric of
Canterbury. He sent his chancellor Ormanetto to Rome to
represent him. Ormanetto arrived just as peace was being
concluded between Philip and the Holy See, and was kindly
received; but the case was referred by the Pope to his nephew
Cardinal Caraffa, Papal Nuncio at Brussels. Caraffa required
that both Pole and Peto should be allowed to go to Rome,
the one to clear himself from the charge of heresy, the other,
that he might aid the Pope with his counsel. But Mary
refused to let Pole go, and the situation thus constituted only
ceased to exist at the death, a few months later, of every one
concerned in it.<a name="FNanchor_683_683"
id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>
The charge against Pole appears to have
been of the flimsiest nature. It was never substantiated, but
it served the purpose of the moment, to oppose an additional
barrier to public peace and concord. It has in no way affected
his reputation for orthodoxy, and he stands out in history as the
model of a devout, loyal, upright Englishman.</p>

<i>Ibid.</i> The proof that this levying of troops to help Philip was not unpopular
is furnished by Surian’s despatch of the 13th May 1557, in which he
says: “The assistance given to the King continues, for the soldiers who are
going to serve his Majesty increase in number daily, and great part of the
nobility of the kingdom are preparing, some from a longing for novelty, which
is peculiar to this nation, some from rivalry and desire of glory, some to obtain
grace and favour with his Majesty and the Queen; and the general opinion is
that upwards of 10,000 troops will pass into Flanders, although the number fixed
was only 5,000. Thus, excuse can be made to the French, that there was no
breach of the treaty. In addition, there will be a considerable force on board the
fleet and in Calais, and on those frontiers, so that some 20,000 men will go out
of England, who are to be ready in the course of this month, when the fleet
likewise is to be in order, though it is not known on what day they will cross
the Channel, it having perhaps not yet been fixed, and possibly it will not
take place so soon, from the want of victuals, which is so great as to be almost
incredible.”</p></div>

Wriothesley, <i>Chronicle</i>, vol. ii., p. 138. As usual, Elizabeth’s was the
name conjured with. Referring to the huge conspiracy of the preceding year,
when her household had not so entirely escaped the consequences as herself,
Clifford, the secretary of the Duchess of Feria, says: “Hereof by many prescriptions
was the Lady Elizabeth held accessory; which the Queen’s Council
would have examined and chastised, but the king again protected her from this
danger. It was consulted that two Catholic gentlemen should be sent to her
to remain there, and observe what passed, and so were sent Sir Thomas Pope
and Mr. Robert Gage. But the lady by her wary carriage, her courteous behaviour
and cunning, and by her public profession of Catholic religion with shew
of zeal did deceive these gentlemen. Before the year was ended, underhand she
had intelligence with Mr. Thomas Stafford, who then exiled in France suddenly
coming into England should title himself king (for that he was descended from
the house of the dukes of Buckingham) and should marry with the Lady Elizabeth;
they supposing themselves strong enough against Queen Mary. It was
not long before Mr. Stafford put this in execution; for coming out of France
only with forty men on 24th April, 1557, and took Scarborough Castle, with
hope that either the Lady Elizabeth would send her forces to fetch him or with
them to come to him herself. But when by the Earl of Westmoreland he was
intercepted, sent to London and beheaded, and some others of his faction hanged,
the relics of this crime remained upon the Lady Elizabeth. It was her luck that
at this time King Philip had returned from Flanders into England, by whose
singular favour she again escaped this plunge” (<i>Life of Jane Dormer, Duchess
of Feria</i>, p. 89).</p></div>

<p class="ac noindent">AT EVENTIDE.</p>

<p class="ac noindent">1558.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Grief</span>, anxiety and disappointment, perpetually assailing a
constitution never one of the strongest, brought the Queen
to her life’s end before she was forty-three. If her naturally
hopeful and buoyant temperament helped her through her
bitterest trials, it was a fertile source of sorrows, as one by
one, all the things upon which she had set her heart, collapsed
like the fabric of a dream.</p>

<p>The loss of Calais inflicted the first mortal blow upon her
enfeebled health, but its poignancy was for a time softened by
the recurrence of the persistent hope, that even now she was
about to give birth to an heir. She had waited till that hope
seemed like certainty, and on the eve of realisation, before
announcing it to Philip. To leave issue, and so secure a
Catholic succession, had been the main incentive to her marriage;
she clung to the prospect as a drowning man to a plank,
and when it failed her, she would have despaired, had she not
been uplifted by the faith and resignation that were stronger
than all her trouble. Philip flattering her delusion had sent
de Feria to congratulate her on her condition, assuring her
that nothing could better console him for the loss of Calais.</p>

<p>Gomez Suarez de Figuera, Count, afterwards Duke, of Feria,
destined to play an important part in English affairs during
the next few months, was, in so far as Philip ever unbent and
allowed himself the luxury of a friend, his most confidential
adviser, remarkably outspoken and unceremonious. He had
accompanied the King from Spain, and was the one Spaniard
who had followed his master’s injunction to the letter, to
adopt a manner of life in conformity with English customs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
and prejudices. So literally did he obey, that he sought and
obtained the hand of the beautiful Jane Dormer, the Queen’s
favourite, and most trusted, attendant and companion.</p>

<p>In the various letters written by de Feria to Philip, on the
Count’s return to England in the spring of 1558, he tells him
how greatly Mary has lost in power and influence, during the
few months that have elapsed since the King’s departure.
The partisans of the new doctrines are beginning to hold up
their heads again, and since the recent disasters, the people,
who formerly frequented the churches through obedience or
fear, are now conspicuous by their absence. This was no
exaggeration, for the loss of Calais was more fatal to Mary’s
government, than anything that had gone before.<a name="FNanchor_684_684"
id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p>Persecution of the heretics had made it unpopular; misfortune
caused it to be despised. Had the Queen possessed
the physical strength and energy she had shown at the time
of Wyatt’s rebellion, she might still have rallied round her an
enthusiastic army, inspired by devotion and loyalty, to dare all
for the recovery of the lost fortresses that were the key to
France. But the sands of life were running low, and all she
could do was to appeal to Philip, trusting that he was England’s
truest friend. De Feria told him that she bore even
the privation of his society patiently, understanding how grave
were the circumstances which detained him in Flanders.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she had ordered the fleet to cruise between
Dunkirk and Dover, in the hope that he would come. By
degrees, she was forced to recognise, that this hope too was a
delusion, and she listened to de Feria when, in obedience to
Philip’s instructions, he suggested that as the King was prevented
from undertaking the journey, it would be well to send
the Admiral, Lord Clinton, to him. His Majesty could thus
communicate to him his displeasure against the Queen’s councillors,
for their neglect in allowing Calais to be taken, and in
affording him so little help. This interview with de Feria
took place at Lambeth. Mary was on her way to St. James’s,
and being ill, had broken her journey at the Cardinal’s palace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
She expressed her willingness to let Clinton go, somewhat to
the surprise of de Feria, who thought she would have shown
some irritation at the proposal. It was tantamount to an
announcement, that she would see her husband’s face no more.</p>

<p>In the Cecil papers at Hatfield, is a Memorandum drawn
up by Lord Clinton, and entitled “The Cause I Was Sent for
to Brussels,” all the items enumerated referring to questions
concerning the harassing of the French coast by the English,
and the reasons, for and against, attempting the reconquest of
Calais.</p>

<p>De Feria had as yet not ventured to seek an interview with
Elizabeth, fearing thereby to displease the Queen, but he sent
his excuses to the Princess, and meanwhile begged Philip to
instruct him, whether he should pay her a visit or not. Philip
ordered him to do so, and on the 23rd June, the diplomatic
Spaniard wrote that he had every reason to be well contented
with the interview which she had granted him, and would
communicate <i>viva voce</i> what had passed between them.<a name="FNanchor_685_685"
id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p>This matter, too important to be penned, undoubtedly
concerned the succession, and Philip’s promise of support, in
case Elizabeth needed it, to make good her claim to the throne
in the event of Mary’s death.</p>

<p>De Feria returned to Brussels, and Philip neither came
nor wrote. It was said that his coldness and indifference were
hurrying the Queen to her grave. Contrary to her usual
symptoms, when attacked by illness, she was devoured by
fever, and wearied by sleepless nights. All who surrounded
her became conscious that there was something new and
alarming in her condition. The first indication of this occurs
in a letter from Cardinal Pole to the King, dated the 6th
September, when she had partially recovered:—</p>

<p>“Don Juan de Acunha will report the particulars of the
Queen’s indisposition, and how our Lord God granted us the
grace four days ago, to free her from all feverish symptoms,
and as her Majesty is not liable to them, they could not but
cause us much anxiety; but the physicians were and are of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
opinion that through this malady, she will obtain relief from
her habitual indisposition; and may it thus please the goodness
of God, and may He preserve her Majesty for the welfare
of this realm. During her malady, the Queen did not fail
to take the greatest care of herself, following the advice of the
physicians, and by continuing to do so, it is hoped that she
will recover, and daily more and more establish her health;
a result to which nothing can contribute more, than to receive
frequent good news of his Majesty.”<a name="FNanchor_686_686"
id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<p>Pole mentions having himself been ill of a quartan ague
which cannot but be regarded as serious at his age, and with
his constitution, but he is resigned to what Divine Providence
shall be pleased to ordain for him. In a further letter, he
recommends to Philip certain individuals of his household,
for whom he has not the means to provide out of his own
substance.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687"

<p>The improvement in Mary’s state was not long maintained,
and on the 29th October, Surian wrote the following important
letter to the Doge, from Brussels:—</p>

<p>“A few days ago, his Majesty received news from England
that the Queen was grievously ill, and her life in danger,
which intelligence, most especially at the present moment
being of very great importance, so disquieted his Majesty, and
all these lords, that it was immediately determined to send
the Count de Feria to visit the Queen, in the name of her
consort, and to treat another affair which I will narrate hereunder;
but as when the Count was about to depart, a fresh
advice arrived, that her Majesty’s health had improved, he
therefore delayed his departure for three or four days longer,
and in the meanwhile, his household at Brussels is preparing
to cross over with him to England, a sign that he will not
return hither so speedily.</p>

<p>“Now the matter to be treated by him is the marriage of
Miladi Elizabeth, to keep that kingdom in any event in the
hands of a person in his Majesty’s confidence. Last year
King Philip gave an order to this effect to his confessor, who
is very dear to the Queen, he laying before her all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
considerations both of religion and piety, and of the safety
of the realms, and to prevent the evils which might occur,
were the Lady Elizabeth, seeing herself slighted, to choose
after her Majesty’s death, or perhaps even during her lifetime,
to take for her husband, some individual who might convulse
the whole kingdom into confusion. For many days, during
which the confessor treated this business, he found the Queen
utterly averse to give Lady Elizabeth any hope of the succession,
obstinately maintaining that she was neither her sister,
nor the daughter of the Queen’s father, King Henry, nor
would she hear of favouring her, as she was born of an infamous
woman, who had so outraged the Queen, her mother
and herself. Notwithstanding this, the confessor assiduously
and adroitly persevering in this design, effected so much, that
her Majesty consented to do what the King wished, he
expressing great satisfaction at this; but two days later, the
Queen changed her mind, and the confessor lays the blame
on Cardinal Pole, who, as the project had not been communicated
to him, may have performed some contrary office,
ignoring that such was the will of the King. Now that things
have been in such danger, owing to the Queen’s malady,
they are sending the Count de Feria, that he may try and
revive this project, and realize it, but I do not yet know
whether with the Duke of Savoy or others, nor can it be
known for certain, until this peace is concluded or excluded;
but the Count’s instructions purport that he is to try and
dispose the Queen to consent to Lady Elizabeth being married
as her sister, and with the hope of succeeding to the crown,
this negotiation having to be treated with the greatest possible
secrecy, because these lords suspect, that were the French to
come to know it, they would easily find means to thwart the
project, as the greater part of England is opposed to the
Queen, and most hostile to King Philip and his dependants,
and much inclined towards Miladi Elizabeth, who has always
shown greater liking for the French faction, than for this
other, being thus habituated in the time of her brother, King
Edward, when at the summit of her grandeur.”<a name="FNanchor_688_688"

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span></p>
<p>The King of Sweden had, during the preceding summer,
sent a proposal for Elizabeth’s hand, and Mary had shown
some displeasure which was shared by Philip, at the fact that
his Majesty had not presented his demand in the ordinary
way, through the Queen. But Elizabeth had refused him,
and while the subject of her sister’s religion mainly preoccupied
Mary during the illness which she felt would end
in death, that of his sister-in-law’s marriage concerned Philip
still more deeply.</p>

<p>In <i>The Life of Jane Dormer, Duchess of Feria</i> it is recorded,<a name="FNanchor_689_689"
id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
that “Queen Mary in her last sickness sent Commissioners
to examine her [Elizabeth] about religion; to whom she
answered, ‘Is it not possible that the queen will be persuaded
I am a Catholic, having so often protested it?’ and thereupon
did swear and vow that she was a Catholic. This is answerable
to what Mr. Camden saith, and is likewise confirmed by
the Duke of Feria’s letter to the king, who in this sickness
of the queen, visited the Lady Elizabeth. He certified him
that she did profess the Catholic religion, and believed the
Real Presence, and was not like to make any alteration for
the principal points of religion.”</p>

<p>The same writer gives a pathetic account of Mary’s end, and
of her constant solicitude for others, which being obtained from
Jane Dormer herself, must be regarded as authentic. It is
necessary to dwell at some length on every known detail of
this period, as some writers have given a highly coloured,
grotesque, and altogether imaginative account of the Queen’s
declining days. Clifford relates that “When it chanced that
Jane was not well, as that she could not well attend upon the
Queen, it is strange, the care and regard her Majesty had of
her, more like a mother or sister, than her queen and mistress.
As in the last days of this blessed queen, she being at Hampton
Court, and to remove to London, Jane having some indisposition,
her Majesty would not suffer her to go in the barge by
water, but sent her by land, in her own litter, and her physician
to attend her. And being come to London, the first that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
she asked for was Jane Dormer, who met her at the stairfoot,
told her that she was reasonably well. The queen answered,
‘So am not I,’ being about the end of August 1558. So took
her chamber and never came abroad again.</p>

<p>“At that time the king was in Flanders about his wars,
made upon the frontiers of France, who understanding the
Queen’s sickness, being then with his army before Dourlens,
sent away the Duke of Feria, to serve and assist her in all that
should be requisite. It pleased Almighty God, that this sickness
was her last, increasing daily, until it brought her to a
better life. Jane was continually about the Queen, not yet
married, for the Queen would not have her marry, until the
king was returned from Flanders; which occasioned the want
of great gifts and rich endowments, wherewith the Queen had
determined, and promised to honour the marriage, whereof
did her Majesty complain. She finding herself languishing to
death, told Jane, she would have been glad to have seen her
marriage had been effected in her days; but God Almighty
would otherwise dispose, and being sick and the king absent,
she was not in case to do what she would. Her sickness was
such as made the whole realm to mourn, yet passed by her
with most Christian patience. She comforted those of them
that grieved about her; she told them what good dreams she
had, seeing many little children, like angels play before her,
singing pleasing notes, giving her more than earthly comfort;
and thus persuaded all, ever to have the holy fear of God before
their eyes, which would free them from all evil, and be a curb
to all temptations. She asked them to think that whatsoever
came to them was by God’s permission; and ever to have
confidence, that He would in mercy turn all to the best.”<a name="FNanchor_690_690"
id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>On the 12th November, Surian wrote the following despatch
in cipher to his Government:—</p>

<p>“There are also advices from England, that the Queen is
not well, and the ambassador from Florence has said to me
and many others, that she is at the point of death, as known
throughout the court, much to the regret of these lords, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
for their own reasons would not wish it to be known that she
was even indisposed, but the truth is, that her malady is evidently
incurable, and will end with her life sooner or later,
according to the increase or decrease of her mental anxieties,
which harass her more than the disease, however dangerous it
may be. The King has therefore sent to England the Count
de Feria, who being a most perfect gentleman and agreeable
to his Majesty, is also in great favour with the Queen, he likewise
fancying himself popular there; but may God grant (in
case of her Majesty’s death) that he do not experience to his
detriment the perverse nature of those people, and their most
inveterate detestation of foreigners, and above all of Spaniards.
He took with him a Portuguese physician, who has a very
great name in these parts, so as not to fail in whatever could
conduce to the Queen’s health. He will at any rate attempt
to carry into effect the design about which I wrote on the 29th
ult. for marrying Miladi Elizabeth, to some personage in the
King’s confidence, in which he hopes to succeed, but I have
not yet been able to hear who will be proposed. She herself
inclines towards a Scottish lord, her kinsman, a handsome and
noble youth, son of a sister of Henry VIII., who was married
in Scotland; he being of the same mind as this lady in the
matter of religion; so were the crown to pass into her hands
with that husband, it might be well-nigh surely prognosticated
that the country will relapse into its former state and worse,
unless the Lord God of His mercy interpose His hand.”<a name="FNanchor_691_691"
id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Mary, having received Elizabeth’s protestation,
sent two members of the Privy Council to the
Princess, announcing that she would leave her the Crown on
two conditions, the first being her promise to maintain the
Catholic faith and worship in England, the second that she
would undertake to pay the Queen’s debts. Both these conditions
Elizabeth accepted.<a name="FNanchor_692_692"
id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>De Feria arrived in London on the 9th November, to find
that the Queen’s recovery was despaired of by all her English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
and Spanish physicians. She was attended only by an Italian
doctor, afterwards suspected of having poisoned her, and was
growing gradually weaker every hour. A smile hovered over
her face when de Feria spoke to her of her husband, but she had
no strength to read the letter which he sent her, in explanation of
the grave reasons for his remaining in Flanders. All she could
do was to send him a ring, as a pledge of her love and fidelity.<a name="FNanchor_693_693"
id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>

<p>From Mary’s death-bed, the envoy passed to the Council
Chamber, where he found all the members assembled except
Pembroke and Paget. He noticed Masone, who was accounted
one of Elizabeth’s most confidential friends, and took the
opportunity of declaring in a loud voice, that the King was
extremely glad, that the Princess was to succeed her sister, and
that he would do all that depended on himself to help her to
mount the throne. The next day, he went to express the same
sentiments to Elizabeth in person. She received him in a
friendly manner, but was less gracious than she had shown
herself to Christopher d’Assonleville, who had visited her in
August, at a moment when she felt less secure of the future,
and to whom she had expressed much gratitude for Philip’s
protection, at a time when she had been suspected by the
Queen. In order to flatter her vanity which was great, de
Feria said that the King had always been very sensible of her
charms, and that if she continued in the Catholic religion, he
would be disposed to seek her hand. She replied with some
asperity, that the King had wished her to marry the Duke of
Savoy, but that she herself could not forget how the Queen
had in a great measure, lost the affection of her people through
having married a foreigner.<a name="FNanchor_694_694"
id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
In concluding his letter, de Feria
remarked that Elizabeth was surrounded by persons as favourable
to heresy as they were hostile to his Majesty, and that she
herself, combining vanity with astuteness, would not fail soon
to follow in the footsteps of her father King Henry VIII.<a name="FNanchor_695_695"
id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<p>De Feria was not alone, in paying court to the rising sun.</p>

<p>“Many personages of the kingdom,” wrote Surian, “flocked
to the house of Miladi Elizabeth [at Hatfield], the crowd constantly
increasing with great frequency.”<a name="FNanchor_696_696"
id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<p>A smaller crowd, but more mixed, gathered round Mary’s
death-bed. It was composed of her most devoted friends—with
the exception of Cardinal Pole, who himself lay dying—and
of those who were eagerly watching for her last sigh.
The end came in the gloomy dawn of the 17th November, and
the sympathetic chronicler of the life of the Duchess of Feria
thus describes the scene:—</p>

<p>“That morning hearing Mass, which was celebrated in her
chamber, she being at the last point (for no day passed in her
life that she heard not Mass), and although sick to death, she
heard it with so good attention, zeal and devotion, as she
answered in every part with him that served the Priest; such
yet was the quickness of her senses and memory. And when
the priest came to that part to say ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agnus Dei, qui tollis
peccata mundi</span></i>,’ she answered plainly and distinctly to every
one, ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere nobis, Miserere nobis, Dona nobis pacem</span></i>’.
Afterwards, seeming to meditate something with herself, when
the Priest took the Sacred Host to consume it, she adored it
with her voice and countenance, presently closed her eyes and
rendered her blessed soul to God. This, the duchess [Jane
Dormer] hath related to me, the tears pouring from her eyes,
that the last thing which the queen saw in this world, was her
Saviour and Redeemer in the Sacramental species; no doubt to
behold Him presently after in His glorious Body in heaven. A
blessed and glorious passage. ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anima mea cum anima
ejus.</span></i>’”<a name="FNanchor_697_697"
id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<p>Monsignor Priuli, writing to his brother ten days later, thus
describes the death of Mary and that of her friend and kinsman,
Reginald Pole:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wrote last week that the Queen’s life was in danger,
and also that of my right reverend Lord, since when, it has
pleased God, so to increase the malady of both, that on the
17th inst., seven hours after midnight, the Queen passed from
this life, and my right reverend Lord followed her at 7 o’clock
in the evening of the same day; and each departed with such
piety as might have been expected from persons who had led
such lives.</p>

<p>“During their illness they confessed themselves repeatedly,
and communicated most devoutly, and two days before their
end, they each received extreme unction, after which it seemed
as if they rallied, and were much comforted, according to the
fruit of that holy medicine. Although two days previously
it had been intimated to his right reverend Lordship, that
there was scarcely any hope of the Queen’s recovering from
her infirmity, this being done, in order that the news of her
demise, coming less suddenly, might prove less grievous to
him, nevertheless, after the event, it was thought well to delay
its announcement, until his Lordship should become more
composed, though it could not have been long deferred, yet
in contradiction to this understanding, one of our countrymen
forgetfully told it him. On hearing it, after remaining silent
for a short while, he then said to his intimate friend, the Bishop
of St. Asaph, and to me, that in the whole course of his life,
nothing had ever yielded him greater pleasure and contentment
than the contemplation of God’s providence, as displayed
in his own person and in that of others, and that in the course
of the Queen’s life, and of his own, he had ever remarked a
great conformity, as she like himself had been harassed during
many years, for one and the same cause, and afterwards, when
it pleased God to raise her to the throne, he had greatly
participated in all her other troubles entailed by that elevation.
He also alluded to their relationship, and to the great
similarity of their dispositions, and to the great confidence
which her Majesty demonstrated in him, saying that besides
the immense mischief which might result from her death, he
could not but feel deep grief thereat, yet by God’s grace, that
same faith and reliance which had ever comforted him in all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
his adversities, greatly consoled him likewise, in this so grievous
a catastrophe. He uttered these words with such earnestness
that it was evident they came from his very heart, and they
even moved him to tears of consolation, at perceiving how
our Lord God, for such a wound received at such a moment
had granted a balm so valid and efficacious, and which might
soothe not only himself, but also all who loved him. His
right reverend Lordship then remained quiet and silent for
about a quarter of an hour, but though his spirit was great,
the blow nevertheless having entered into his flesh, brought
on the paroxysm earlier, and with more intense cold than he
had hitherto experienced, so that he said he felt this would
be his last. He therefore desired, that there might be kept
near him the book containing those prayers which are said
for the dying. He then had Vespers repeated as usual, and
the Compline, which part of the office yet remained for him
to hear; and this was about two hours before sunset, he
having on the very same morning heard Mass also, as was
his daily custom. In fine it was evident, that as in health
that sainted soul was ever turned to God, so likewise in this
long and troublesome infirmity, did it continue thus until his
end, which he made so placidly, that he seemed to sleep rather
than to die, as did the Queen likewise, so that had not a
physician perceived the act, her Majesty would have died
without any one’s witnessing it. My affection has moved me
thus minutely to detail the end of this truly holy prelate and
of this sainted Queen.”<a name="FNanchor_698_698"
id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>It is scarcely matter for surprise that Mary’s time-serving
Council should have made no long lingering over their mistress’s
yet warm ashes. The scene was quickly changed from
St. James’s to Hatfield, where Sir Nicholas Throckmorton was
the first to acquaint Elizabeth with the news of her accession.</p>

<p>After being embalmed, Mary’s body lay in state in the
chapel of St. James’s Palace, till the 12th December, when it
was removed to Westminster Abbey. Strype thus quaintly
describes the funeral procession:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>“When the day was come, after this manner were her
funerals performed. Her corpse was brought from St. James’s
where she died, in a chariot, with a picture or image resembling
her person, adorned with crimson velvet, her crown on
her head, and her sceptre in her hand, and many good rings
on her fingers.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699"
class="fnanchor">[699]</a> And so up the highway went the foremost
standard, with the falcon and the hart. Then came great
company of mourners. And after, another goodly standard of
the lion and the falcon, followed by King Philip her husband’s
servants, two and two together, in black gowns; heralds riding
to and fro to see all go in order. After, came the third standard
with the white greyhound and the falcon. Then came
gentlemen in gowns, mourners. Then came riding esquires,
bearing banners of arms. Next came the lord Marquis of
Winchester, on horseback, bearing the banner of the arms of
England, embroidered with gold. Then Mr. Chester, the
herald, bearing the helm and the crest and mantles. Then
Mr. Norroy bearing the target, with the garter and the crown.
Then Mr. Clarencieux, bearing the sword. And after, Mr.
Garter bearing her coat armour: all on horseback. Banners
were borne about her by lords and knights, with four heralds
on horseback, bearing four white banners of saints, wrought
with fine gold, <i>viz.</i>, Mr. Somerset, Mr. Lancaster, Mr. Windsor
and Mr. York. Then came the corpse with her picture lying
over her, covered with cloth of gold, the cross silver. Then
followed Mr. —— with the chief mourners. And then ladies
riding, all in black trailed to the ground. In the chariot,
wherein the Queen lay, rode the pages of honour with banners
in their hands. Afore the corpse, her chapel, and after, all
the monks, and after them the bishops in order. And all in
this equipage passed by Charing Cross to Westminster Abbey,
where at the great doors of the church, everybody alighted off
their horses. Then were gentlemen ready to take the Queen
out of her chariot: and so earls and lords went before her
towards the hearse,<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700"
class="fnanchor">[700]</a> with her picture borne between men of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
worship. At the church door, met her four bishops and the
abbot, mitred, in copes, censing the body; and so she lay
all night under the hearse with watch. <i>Item.</i> There were an
hundred poor men in good black gowns, bearing long torches,
with hoods on their heads, and arms on them. And about her
the guard, bearing staff-torches, in black coats. And all the
way chandlers, having torches to supply them that had their
torches burnt out.”<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701"
class="fnanchor">[701]</a></p>

<p>The next day, being the 13th December, a Mass of
Requiem was sung, and Dr. White, Bishop of Winchester,
preached the funeral sermon. Mary had been dead nearly
a month, and by this time it required some courage to speak
of her in terms of praise, affection or gratitude. “For such
offenses as he committed in his sermon at the funeralles of the
late Queen,”<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702"
class="fnanchor">[702]</a> Dr. White was ordered to keep his house during
the Queen’s pleasure. The sting lay in the eulogy contained
in the following fragments of his discourse:—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>
<p>“She was a King’s daughter, she was a King’s sister, she
was a King’s wife. She was a Queen, and by the same title
a King also: she was sister to her, that by the like title and
right, is both King and Queen at this present of this realm.
These be great gifts and benefactions of God; who in his
gifts is ever to be glorified. What she suffered in each of
these degrees before and since she came to the crown I will
not chronicle; only this I say, howsoever it pleased God to
will her patience to be exercised in the world, she had in all
estates, the fear of God in her heart. I verily believe the
poorest creature in all this city feared not God more than
she did. She had the love, commendation and admiration of
all the world.... She was never unmindful or uncareful of
her promise to her realm. She used singular mercy towards
offenders. She used much pity and compassion towards the
poor and oppressed. She used clemency among her nobles.
She restored more noble houses decayed than ever did prince
of this realm, or I pray God ever shall have the like occasion
to do hereafter. She restored to the Church such ornaments
as in the time of schism were taken away and spoiled. She
found the realm poisoned with heresy, and purged it, and remembering
herself to be a member of Christ’s Church, refused
to write herself <i>head</i> thereof.... Such was her knowledge
as well as virtue; neither was there ever prince on earth that
had more of both. But although she were such a one yet
could she not be immortal. It pleased God, in whose hands
the heart and breath, the life and death, the beginning and
end of princes is, to call her from this mortal life, of the
pleasures whereof (the pleasure that she took in the service of
God only excepted) as no person than her, I suppose, took
less, so of troubles and bitterness of the same none here for
his estate taketh more.”</p>

<p>After giving an account of her preparation for death, and
of her last moments, the preacher went on to say that, having
received the blessing of the Church, “she bowed down her
head and withal yielded a mild and gracious spirit into the
hands of her Maker. All this I say,” he added, “if it were
as pithily expressed, as she godly and devoutly did it, should
be to you as it was to them that saw it, more than ten such
sermons. If angels were mortal, I would rather liken this
her departure to the death of an angel, than of a mortal
creature. After this sort died this gracious Queen, of whom
we may justly say, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laudavi mortuam magis quam viventem</span></i>,
and although we doubt not of her estate, yet because it is
temerity to pronounce of God’s secret judgments, or to
deny prayer, to deny to one which is due to all, let us
again commend her soul to God, wishing to her as Tertullian
teacheth <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">refrigerium et in prima
resurrectione consortium</span></i>.
Which prayer if it relieve not her, as one that with God’s
grace and mercy hath the effect thereof already, yet shall it
help us the rather before God, from whom the prayer of the
faithful is never turned back or in vain.</p>

<p>“And as we for our parts have received worthily detriment
and discomfort upon her departing, so let us comfort ourselves
in the other sister, whom God hath left, wishing her
a prosperous reign, in peace and tranquillity, with the blessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
which the prophet speaketh of, if it be God’s will <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ut videat
filios filiorum et pacem super Israel</span></i>, ever confessing that, though
God hath mercifully provided for them both, yet <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mariam
optimam partem elegit</span></i>; because it is still a

<p>The displeasure which Dr. White incurred for his panegyric
of Mary,<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704"
class="fnanchor">[704]</a> was but the beginning of a systematic
blackening of her memory, by those, whose interest it was to
stand well with Elizabeth. Eleven out of the thirty-five
members who composed Mary’s Privy Council at the end of
her reign became Privy Councillors under Elizabeth, a process
that entailed some turning of coats for the second and even
the third time. Those pamphleteers and manufacturers of
low abuse, who had embittered Mary’s last days with insult
and calumny might now pursue their trade unmolested, while
the loose statements of reformers such as John Knox, John
Foxe and John Bale,<a name="FNanchor_705_705"
id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>
afterwards too carelessly credited, and
copied by Strype, Burnet and others, and elaborated by Hume
and Froude, have marred beyond recognition the reputation
of one who has been tardily recognised in our own day, as
“amongst the best, although not the greatest of our sovereigns”.<a name="FNanchor_706_706"

<p>No monument has ever been raised to the memory of
Queen Mary I. Two small black tablets mark the spot
where she lies buried, in the north aisle of Henry VIIth’s
Chapel in Westminster Abbey, at the foot of the tomb erected
by James I. over the remains of Elizabeth. They bear this
inscription:—</p>

<p>Mary’s last Will and Testament, dated the 30th April
1558, with a Codicil, added a little more than a fortnight before
her death, is an interesting and characteristic document, containing
many glimpses into her mind and heart. It was not
only entirely ignored by Elizabeth, but lay utterly forgotten
for nearly 300 years. Sir Frederick Madden printed a copy
of it in 1831.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707"

</div>

<p class="ac noindent"><i>VERITAS TEMPORIS FILIA.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> live in an age of criticism. Epithets will no longer
serve in lieu of evidence, and we are called upon to revise the
hasty judgments of past centuries, and to reconsider their
verdicts. The verdict passed on Mary I. has hitherto been
founded on the one-sided testimony of her enemies, and on
their showing, the world has taken for granted that she was
at the best a gloomy, narrow-minded bigot, whose life was
utterly unproductive of good to England. Her very trials
and sorrows have led the most indulgent to conclude, that she
must in consequence have been of a melancholy disposition,
and to find in her misfortunes an excuse for the moroseness
which in their opinion, rendered her the most unattractive
personality in our history. Moroseness is a fit accompaniment
to cruelty and thirst for blood; and thus, by easy
stages, it has been possible to imagine her gloating over the
executions for religion’s sake, which disgraced her reign as
they did those of her predecessors and successors, down to the
time of Charles II.</p>

<p>Such, however, has not been the picture presented to us
in the course of our study of the State papers, dealing with her
life and reign, and “all history,” said the learned Dr. Samuel
Johnson, “so far as it is not supported by contemporary
evidence, is romance”.<a name="FNanchor_708_708"
id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>
We have seen her, as represented in
the secret despatches of ambassadors, in her own private
letters, in those of Cardinal Pole, in the narratives of her
contemporaries, in the brief chronicles of her time, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
occasional admissions of her enemies; we have seen her as a
girl, a woman, a queen, in a dozen different lights, and we
have found an image, the very reverse of that which for three
centuries has been held up to the world’s execration.</p>

<p>That Mary was not in advance of her contemporaries
should scarcely be a reproach. What wonder even, if she
looked to the past for inspiration, from amidst the chaos of
new opinions, that seemed to her productive only of rebellion,
licence and impiety! She could remember the time, when
order reigned in Church and State, and when peace resulted
from obedience to civil and ecclesiastical authority. With
the change had begun all her miseries. Cromwell and Cranmer,
the apostles of the new regime, had played her father’s
game of tyranny and rapine, and their followers had made
havoc of her own projects of peace and prosperity. Had the
new religionists been mere harmless, loyal, quiet folk, the fires
of Smithfield had never been lighted.<a name="FNanchor_709_709"
id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>
Hence, it was inevitable
that all novelty should be regarded by her with suspicion, as
synonymous with evil, and she died in the fruitless attempt
to resist the inflowing tide. She was wanting neither in intelligence
nor devotion to her people; what she lacked was
the touch of genius to discern the actual trend of the new,
restless ideas, that made her kingdom into a battle-field, and
inspiration and tact, to guide them into peaceful channels.
Absorbed in the inherited notions of an ideal good, she
missed much of the practical good that lay within her grasp,
and had she been less conscientious, she might have been a
greater Queen.</p>

<p>It is not possible to exonerate her completely, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
matter of her formal condemnation of her mother’s marriage,
although she was therein herself the victim, her only valid
excuse being, that the Emperor had caught her in the toils of
his diplomatic sophistry, and had blinded her judgment with
the glamour of his arguments.</p>

<p>Her character, therefore, was not without some inconsistencies—and
indeed of whom can the reverse be declared?
Those who have extolled her more than virile courage, as it
was exhibited in her early trials, during her persecution by
Edward’s Council, in her manner of meeting Northumberland’s
conspiracy, in her dealing with Wyatt’s rebellion, and
on many smaller occasions, have generally overlooked the
feminine weakness, with which she almost always yielded
when her affections intervened. Thus, after having braved
Henry’s anger, and stoutly maintained her mother’s rights
and her own, fearless of the axe that hung by a thread
over her, she gave in, when Katharine was beyond the reach
of harm, from a, to us, almost incomprehensible longing for
her father’s love, and in her childlike confidence that the
Emperor could not lead her astray. She had taken up a
logical attitude with reference to Elizabeth, which was the
complement of the disgust, with which she regarded Elizabeth’s
mother; but this attitude was at once abandoned
when Anne Boleyn’s disgrace involved the child in the same
ignominy and ruin. Mary had but just regained a certain
amount of consideration for her own position, but she did
not hesitate generously to risk all, by calling Henry’s attention
to the neglected child, once her own triumphant rival. “My
sister Elizabeth is in good health,” she ventured to write to
the inhuman tyrant, “and such a child toward, as I doubt not
your highness shall have cause to rejoice of in time coming.”
<i>The Privy Purse Expenses of the Princess Mary</i> are eloquent
of her generosity towards “the Lady Elizabeth’s grace,” and
until Elizabeth forfeited her esteem by making common cause
with her enemies, there was no diminution of cordiality on
the part of the Queen towards her sister. She married Philip
of Spain in spite of all opposition, in the first place for the
sake of the realm, and in the hope of issue, and gave him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
passionate devotion. In most of these things Mary was a
true woman, no heroine, but tender and human to a fault. Of
her learning and accomplishments, much has been said in the
course of this history. Her contemporaries have been warm
in praise of the high order of her intellect, of her knowledge
of ancient and modern languages, of her musical talents, of her
skill in dancing. Her translation of the <i>Paraphrases</i> of Erasmus
proves that her reputation for scholarship proceeded from
no mere courtier-like flattery. And the same may be said of
the general terms of praise in which foreign envoys wrote of
her to their governments. Their communications being altogether
secret, and often written in cipher, could have been
penned with no ulterior views of pleasing Mary or her friends.
Until within a year of her death, there is no allusion in their
despatches to any despondency on her part. She felt her
husband’s absence acutely, and it may have been that his
indifference to her hastened her death; but contrary to what
David Hume and his followers would have us believe, it is
clear that no spirit of settled bitterness brooded over any
portion, even the saddest, of her life. Nothing is more
evident in her story, as it is told in the State Papers, than
that to the end, her disposition was to hope against hope,
to believe that her prayers would be answered, to trust that
good would come out of evil; and not one despairing word
is recorded as ever having passed her lips.<a name="FNanchor_710_710"
id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a></p>

<p>We have had various descriptions of Mary’s personal
appearance, of her manner and character, from those who
came in contact with her at different periods. There still
remains to be chronicled the impression which the Queen
produced on the mind of Giovanni Michiel, and which he
describes in his account of England in 1557, at a time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
therefore, when the charm of youth was past, and when she
was approaching her end.</p>

<p>After describing her as of low, rather than middling stature
and of a spare and delicate frame, quite unlike her father,
who was tall and stout, or her mother who was portly, he says
that her face, as can be seen by her portraits, is well proportioned
in features and lineaments. He mentions the fact
that when younger, she was considered not merely tolerably
handsome, but of beauty exceeding mediocrity. At present,
with the exception of some wrinkles, caused more by anxieties
than by age, which make her appear some years older, “she
is a seemly woman and never to be loathed for ugliness, even
at her present age, without considering her degree of queen”.
Her expression is very grave, her eyes are so piercing, that
they inspire not only respect but fear, in those on whom she
fixes them, although she is very short-sighted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span> “Her voice
is rough and loud almost like a man’s, so that when she
speaks, she is always heard a long way off.... But whatever
may be the amount deducted from her physical endowments
as much more may with truth and without flattery be added
to those of her mind, as besides the facility and quickness of
her understanding, which comprehends whatever is intelligible
to others, even to those who are not of her own sex (a marvellous
gift for a woman) she is skilled in five languages, not
merely understanding but speaking four of them fluently, <i>viz.</i>,
English, Latin, French, Spanish and Italian, in which last however
she does not venture to converse, although it is well
known to her; but the replies she gives in Latin, and her very
intelligent remarks made in that tongue, surprise everybody.
Besides woman’s work, such as embroidery of every sort with
the needle, she also practises music, playing especially on
the clavicorde (a sort of spinet or small harpsichord) and
on the lute, so excellently, that when intent on it (though
now she plays rarely) she surprised the best performers, both
by the rapidity of her hand and by her style of playing.
Such are her virtues and external accomplishments. Internally,
with the exception of certain trifles, in which to say the
truth she is like other women, being sudden and passionate
and close and miserly,<a name="FNanchor_711_711"
id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711"
class="fnanchor">[711]</a> rather more so than would become
a bountiful and generous queen.”</p>

<p>In other respects, he maintains that she has “no notable
imperfections, whilst in certain things she is singular and
without an equal; for not only is she brave and valiant,
unlike other timid and spiritless women, but so courageous
and resolute, that neither in adversity nor peril did she ever
display or commit any act of cowardice or pusillanimity,
maintaining always on the contrary, a wonderful grandeur and
dignity, knowing what became the dignity of a sovereign as
well as any of the most consummate statesmen in her service;
so that from her way of proceeding, and from the method
observed by her (and in which she still perseveres) it cannot
be denied, that she shows herself to have been born of truly
royal lineage. Of her humility, piety and religion it is unnecessary
to speak, or bear witness to them, as they are not
only universally acknowledged, but recently blazoned by
proofs and facts, which fell little short of martyrdom, by reason
of the persecutions she endured; so that it may be said of her,
as Cardinal Pole says with truth, that in the darkness and
obscurity of that kingdom, she remained precisely like a feeble
light, buffeted by raging winds for its utter extinction, but
always kept burning, and defended by her innocence and
lively faith, that it might shine in the world, as it now does
shine. It is certain that few women (I do not speak of
princesses or queens but of private women) are known to be
more assiduous at their prayers than she is, never choosing
to suspend them for any impediment whatever, going at the
canonical hours with her chaplains either to church in public,
or to her private chapel, doing the like with regard to the
communion and fast days, and finally to all other christian
works, precisely like a nun and a religious.”</p>

<p>After commenting on Mary’s weak health, on her disappointed
hopes of maternity, on her grief at the insurrections,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
conspiracies and plots formed against her daily, Michiel goes
on to say, that although these have resulted auspiciously for
the Queen, and inauspiciously for their authors, “yet nevertheless
it being necessary on such occasions to proceed to
capital punishment or confiscation, against one person or
another, sometimes for crime, and sometimes on suspicion,
she knows that by these means, the hatred and indignation
she inspires are increased, the delinquents being not only
excused almost by everybody, but the causes, such as the
expulsion of foreigners (who are most odious to the English,
on account of the Spaniards) or the religion, or both together
assigned by the conspirators for their movements, being tacitly
approved of. The consequence is, that as until now, the plots
have been set on foot by the commonalty, and persons of mean
extraction, so from the fickleness of that nation, were they
excited by some personage or nobleman of importance, there
is no doubt, they would create a great revolution throughout
the realm, much to the personal danger of the Queen, and of
her life, the kingdom being still full of humours and discontent,
and the country showing a greater inclination and readiness
for change than ever, provided it has a leader. Besides these
and many other distresses, the Queen witnesses the daily increasing
decline of the affection evinced towards her universally
at the commencement of her reign, which in truth was such
and so extraordinary, that never was greater shown in that
kingdom towards any sovereign; and she is also harassed by
the poverty in which she sees the Crown, owing not only to
the past debts and disorders, but to the many expenses and
the wants incurred in her own time, which prevent her from
showing courtesy and liberality such as become a sovereign,
either to her own subjects or to others. She is compelled on
the contrary (there being no other remedy) daily to repeat her
demands for loans and subsidies, which have now become such
a grievance, and so much the more odious to the people, as
notwithstanding all the subsidies, the creditors remain unpaid,
the majority having arrears due to them for entire years, so
that their clamours and complaints being redoubled, the hatred
of all other malcontents increases proportionably. These and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
many others are the public causes of the Queen’s distress, and
although they are held by her in great account, she nevertheless
feels them less painfully than certain others, which affect
her personally, as respecting those already mentioned by me,
she comforts herself with the hope of their being remedied in
the course of time, by the counsel and diligence of some of her
ministers, especially Cardinal Pole, through the care taken by
them to investigate and retrench superfluities and abuses, and
thus with the aid of parsimony, getting out of debt as she
expects to do shortly, so as then to be enabled to use liberality,
confer favours and rewards, and relieve those who are in want.”<a name="FNanchor_712_712"
id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p>Michiel, in continuing his report, ascribes the Queen’s
principal distress to two causes. It proceeds, he says, from
love and hatred—from excessive love of her husband, of his
character and manners, believed by Michiel to be such as to
captivate any one; and from hatred of Elizabeth. He considers
that no one could have been a better husband than
Philip, nor so good a one, and that to think of losing him, as
he and the Queen can only meet by accident, would be irksome
and grievous to any person who loved another heartily, and
is assuredly so to a woman who is naturally tender. “If,” he
continues, “to this violent love were to be added jealousy,
<i>which as yet she is not known to feel</i> ... she would be truly
miserable; and this separation is one of the anxieties that
especially distresses her.”<a name="FNanchor_713_713"
id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a></p>

<p>Without stopping to question the accuracy of Michiel’s
assertion, that no one could have been a better husband than
Philip, we pass on to what the Venetian considers the second
principal cause of Mary’s distress, namely her “hatred of
Elizabeth”. The expression is a strong one, and scarcely
compatible with what he has already related of her piety,
humility and prayerfulness. But “although dissembled,” the
Queen, he tells us, “displays in many ways the scorn and
ill-will she bears her ... whenever she sees her, fancying
herself in the presence of the affronts and ignominious treatment
to which she was subjected on account of her mother,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
from whom, in great part, the divorce from Queen Katharine
originated. But what disquiets her most of all is, to see the
eyes and hearts of the nation already fixed on this lady as
successor to the Crown, from despair of descent from the
Queen, to whom the demonstration and the thought are so
much the more bitter and odious, as it would be grievous not
only to her but to any one, to see the illegitimate child of a
criminal, who was punished as a public ——, on the point of
inheriting the throne, with better fortune than herself, whose
descent is rightful, legitimate and regal. Besides this, the
Queen’s hatred is increased, by knowing her to be averse to
the present religion, she not only having been born in the
other, but being versed and educated in it; for although externally
she showed, and by living catholically shows, that she
has recanted, she is nevertheless supposed to dissemble, and
to hold it more than ever internally.”<a name="FNanchor_714_714"
id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>Strong feeling and strong language were natural in the
days in which the above words were written, and a certain
exaggeration of expression may be granted to an Italian,
whose mother tongue flowed in superlatives. But Mary
could not have been so ardent a lover, so devoted a friend,
so kind a benefactress, if she had not also been quick to
experience resentment, indignation, scorn and contempt.
Elizabeth had been always the great antagonism of her
life, and although Mary had repeatedly overcome her aversion,
in very generous ways, her sister had done nothing to
make her task an easier one. From the outset, their dispositions
were as the poles asunder. Mary’s meaning was ever
plain, expressed sometimes even bluntly; there was never
anything the least ambiguous, either in her spoken or her
clearly written words, in a hand admirably indicative of her
firm, straightforward character. Elizabeth was at the best an
enigma. It was impossible to judge whether any meaning lay
behind her elaborate assurances which assured nothing; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
her tortuous phrases served but to conceal whatever plan her
cunning, secretive brain harboured. On the rare occasions
when she was compelled to speak out, and declare herself,
her utterances were for the most part falsified in the event.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely that Mary’s self-conquest in regard to
Elizabeth, at the time of the latter’s abandonment and disgrace,
would have resulted in a lasting affection, founded on
pity, and that motherly instinct so strongly developed in the
Queen, had not her sister persistently thrown herself into the
arms of the rebels. At the time of Henry’s death, and until
the beginning of Mary’s reign, their relations were as cordial
as it was possible for Mary to make them. But in a very
short time, Elizabeth became a source of constant annoyance
and danger, and pursuing her underhand tactics to the end
she thoroughly alienated and disgusted the Queen. If, for
reasons of policy, Philip induced his wife to treat her as
though she were innocent, the position was not thereby improved.</p>

<p>The purity of Mary’s court, at a period when licence was
the order of the day, was the subject of much comment by
her contemporaries. Her care for the honour and good
repute of those about her, is illustrated by the following
occurrence, which shows also the gentle manner in which she
administered rebuke, when rebuke was necessary.</p>

<p>“Queen Mary being in the gallery, ready to go to the
chapel, within the traverse, the Lord William Howard, Lord
Chamberlain being with her, he taking his leave; without the
traverse stood the maids of honour, expecting to wait on the
queen to the chapel. Mrs. Frances Neville standing next
to the traverse, the Lord Chamberlain passing by, a merry
gentleman, took her by the chin saying: ‘My pretty ——
(a word unfit for repetition) how dost thou?’ Which the
queen saw and heard, the traverse being drawn. The queen
gone forth, finding her farthingale at her foot loose, made sign
to Mrs. Neville to pin it, which, kneeling down she did. The
queen then took her by the chin as he had done saying:
‘God-a-mercy, my pretty ——’. She hearing the queen
say thus, so blushed as she seemed to be astonished, replying:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
‘Madam, what says your Majesty?’ still upon her knees,
and seemed to be much troubled. The queen answered,
‘What is the matter? Have I said or done more than the
Lord Chamberlain did? And may not I be as bold with
thee as he?’ She replied: ‘My Lord Chamberlain is an idle
gentleman, and we respect not what he saith or doth; but
your Majesty from whom I think never any heard such a
word, doth amaze me, either in jest or earnest to be called so
by you. A —— is a wicked misliving woman.’ The queen
took it, ‘Thou must forgive me; for I meant no harm’.”</p>

<p>The troubles arising from religious questions occupy so
large a portion of Mary’s short reign, that a substantial reform
of the criminal law, which at another period would have excited
interest and admiration, has almost escaped the notice
of historians. It was indeed in the reign of Edward VI.
that a jury first began to be a fair and effective tribunal, but
Mary’s noble exordium in appointing Morgan, Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas, contained the first indication of the
precept, that not only was equity to be maintained among
the people, but that in cases in which the Crown was involved,
the like justice was to be done. “I charge you, Sir,”
said the Queen, “to minister the law and justice indifferently,
without respect of persons; and notwithstanding the old
error among you, which will not admit any witness to speak,
or other matters to be heard, in favour of the adversary, the
Crown being party, it is my pleasure that whatever cases be
brought, in favour of the subject may be admitted and heard.
You are to sit there not as advocates for me, but as indifferent
judges between me and my people.”<a name="FNanchor_715_715"
id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p>That this was no empty formula was proved in the
following year, when a jury persisted in acquitting a prisoner
of State, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, against the direction
of the court, and as was well known against the personal
conviction of the Queen,<a name="FNanchor_716_716"
id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>
who believed in his guilt. Throughout
Mary’s reign, the accused had absolute confidence in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
uprightness, integrity and unhampered freedom of the jury,
and never forgot, that a statute of the realm had expressly
declared, that there should be two witnesses to prove a treason,
and that they must be confronted face to face. Hitherto,
and in the subsequent reigns, persons indicted on behalf of
the Crown, whatever their rights, had no probability of a
favourable decision, on account of the paramount advantages
claimed and enjoyed by the counsel for the sovereign.
Many instances of this arbitrary and tyrannical rule are to be
found in the minutes of the State trials under Elizabeth and
James I.</p>

<p>If, in some ways, Mary seemed to have inherited a large
amount of Tudor obstinacy, her sincere and earnest intention
to act according to the light of conscience, and to govern by
strictly constitutional methods, made her singularly unlike her
father before, or her sister after her. No flattery however
insidious, on the part of those who sought to ingratiate themselves
with her, by advocating a more unrestricted course,
was able to lure her from this lofty resolve. A rebel who
had been pardoned, and who thought by this means to secure
her favour, drew up a plan by which she might render herself
independent of Parliaments. It was presented to her by the
Spanish ambassador, who ventured to recommend its adoption.
As the Queen read it, she disliked it, “and judged it contrary
to the oath she had made at her coronation”. She sent for
Gardiner, and giving him the treatise to read, commanded
him as he would answer for it at the judgment seat of God,
to tell her his real opinion of the matter. “Madam,” replied
the Chancellor, on returning the volume to her, “it is a pity
that so noble and virtuous a lady should be endangered with
the pernicious devices of such lewd and subtle sycophants.
For the book is naught, and most horrible to be thought
on.” The Queen thanked him, and threw the volume into
the fire.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717"
class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<p>There are important indications in the records of this reign
showing that had Mary’s lines been cast in more peaceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
places, and had her life been prolonged, much would have
been done to develop international and commercial interests.
Shortly before Edward’s death, a joint-stock company had
been formed under the direction of Sebastian Cabot, son of
the famous navigator. A small fleet commanded by Sir
Hugh Willoughby was fitted out, and sailed for the north of
Europe, with the object of discovering a north-east passage
to China and India. Off the coast of Norway, their ships
were scattered by a violent storm, and Challoner, the second
officer in command, found his way into the White Sea, and
reached Archangel in safety. The others were cast upon the
shores of Nova Zembla, and Russian Lapland, where they all
perished from cold and want. Challoner, obliged to abandon
the original enterprise, travelled through Russia to Moscow,
where he was kindly received by the Czar, Ivan Wassilegevich,
who gave him a letter to the King of England. Edward
being then dead, the letter was consequently delivered to
Mary, and Challoner’s reports of the wonderful sights he had
witnessed roused a keen spirit of adventure in the nation. A
new company was formed, and directed by the same Sebastian
Cabot, and was incorporated under the title of “<i>Merchants
adventurers of England, for the discovery of lands, territories,
isles and signories unknown</i>”. A charter was granted to the
company, by which its members were empowered to make
discoveries by navigating northwards, north-westwards or
north-eastwards, and were entitled to raise the flag of England
over “all manner of cities, towns, isles and main lands of
infidelity,” after subduing them to the dominion of the King
and Queen, and their heirs and successors for ever.<a name="FNanchor_718_718"
id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> It was
the beginning of the brilliant exploits by which England
became subsequently so formidable, under the semi-piratical
enterprises of Drake, Frobisher and Sir Walter Raleigh.</p>

<p>Challoner was sent back to Moscow, with a letter from
Philip and Mary to the Czar, containing the initiative towards
a commercial treaty between England and Russia.<a name="FNanchor_719_719"
id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> The expedition
was eminently successful, and he returned, accompanied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
by the Russian ambassador, as far as the Bay of Pitsligo, where
the ship was wrecked, and Challoner was drowned. The
ambassador escaped, but as he had suffered considerable loss
at the hands of the Scotch, who plundered the wreck, Mary
sent two messengers to Edinburgh, to redress his wrongs, and
bring him with honour and distinction to London. After
some difficulties, the commercial treaty with Russia was concluded,
under very advantageous conditions for England, and
the ambassador went back to his own country, loaded with
costly presents for himself and his sovereign. By this treaty
English trade received a great impetus, and henceforth the
manufactures of the country were exchanged at a vast profit
for the skins and other valuable products of Russia.</p>

<p>Mary also defended English commercial interests against
the cupidity of a powerful company of foreign merchants, who
had been settled in London for centuries, and were known as
Easterlings, merchants of the Hanse towns, and merchants of
the Steelyard. The privileges granted to them by generations
of English kings, in return for the loans which their immense
resources enabled them to advance in sudden emergencies,
had accumulated until they had almost absolute control of
the markets. One great subject of complaint was their exemption
from paying more than 1 per cent. duty on their
merchandise, which included almost every imaginable article
of commerce, so that all competition was excluded, and they
could raise or depress the prices as they pleased. It had been
declared on investigation, that they had violated, and therefore
forfeited their charter, but they were powerful enough to
dispute its possession, until the bill of tonnage and poundage
passed in Mary’s first Parliament aimed a decisive blow at
their excessive privileges, by enacting that the Easterlings
should pay the same duties as other merchants. The Queen
was induced to suspend for a time the operation of the
statute, but having ascertained what were, in this respect,
the real interests of her people, she finally revoked the
charter, and refused to listen to any further arguments in
favour of the company.<a name="FNanchor_720_720"
id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span></p>
<p>Among many interesting facts, hitherto ignored by Mary’s
biographers, are the benefits which the Queen bestowed on
her army. Two of these call for special remark, the first
being an increase of pay from 6d. to 8d. a day, the sum for
which the men had mutinied under Henry VIII.; the second
being a touching instance of her care for them, expressed in
her last will. In this document it will be seen, she left instructions
for the foundation of a hospital in London, with an
endowment of 400 marks, “for the relief and help of poor,
impotent and aged soldiers,” who had suffered loss or wounds
in the service of England. “For all her man’s voice and
masculine will,” says a recent writer, “she had a woman’s
heart, which warmed to the deserving old soldier, and whatever
her demerits in the eyes of those who wear the gown, her
memory may at least be cherished by those who wear the
red coat.” She was the first English sovereign to lend a
pitying ear to the necessities of those who had spent
themselves in their country’s defence; while as for her immediate
successor, Elizabeth has been declared by the same
writer to have been “intolerably impatient of such miserable
creatures”.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721"
class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>But if the whole truth were known, it is certain that
evidence would be forthcoming to prove that “those who
wear the gown” have as little cause as soldiers to speak of
Mary’s “demerits”. The history of our universities has yet
to be adequately written, but when it is written, important
instances will doubtless come to light, concerning her connection
with both. Dr. John Christopherson, her chaplain and
confessor, was installed master of Trinity College, Cambridge,
in 1553, and through him, the Queen became a considerable
benefactress to this college. She was especially anxious that
it should possess a larger and more suitable chapel, and on her
initiative, the present building was begun in the Tudor style in
1556.<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722"
class="fnanchor">[722]</a> Carrying her solicitude still further, she added to the
endowments of Trinity, the Rectories of Heversham, Kendal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
and Kirkby Lonsdale in Westmorland, and those of Sedbergh
and Aysgarth in Yorkshire, then producing a revenue of £338
per annum, for the maintenance of twenty scholars, ten
choristers and their master, thirteen poor scholars, fourteen
chaplains and two sizars.<a name="FNanchor_723_723"
id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
In the Master’s Lodge, where
Mary slept when she passed through Cambridge, on her way
to London at the time of her accession, is a portrait of the
Queen inscribed <i>Maria Regina Huius Collegii Benefactrix</i>.
The picture is one of the replicas of the portrait painted by
Sir Antonio More, before her marriage, with some variations
as to minor details. Seeing how entirely Mary has passed
from the minds and hearts of the English people, it is pleasant
to learn that she is still commemorated at Trinity College, in
a prayer said after grace on feast days.</p>

<p>The portrait which she presented to Christ Church, Oxford,
and another in the University galleries, show her interest in
that seat of learning also. During her short reign, two
colleges were founded at Oxford; Trinity, by the munificence
of Sir Thomas Pope, and St. John’s, on the site of
Archbishop Chicheley’s foundation, the latter being the gift
of Sir Thomas White, of the company of Merchant Tailors.</p>

<p>Sir Aubrey de Vere, in his little-known poem <i>Mary Tudor</i>,
struck a right chord, in putting into the mouth of the unhappy
Queen the words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

      <div class="verse">Shall prey on my remains. My name shall last</div>
	  <div class="verse">To fright the children of the race I love.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But the real Mary was perhaps a truer prophet, when she
foresaw the dawn of a better day, and chose for her motto
the device—</p>

Peter Frarin of Antwerp, Master of Arts, and Bachelor of both laws,
writing in the next reign says enthusiastically: “I could declare unto you how
the traitorous gospellers of England gathered a main host against their most
virtuous lady Queen Marie, the rare treasure, the peerless jewel, the most
perfect pattern and example of our days. How they shot arrows and darts
against her court gates, conspired her death, devised to poison and kill her with
a dagg at one time, with a privy dagger at another time, reviled her, called her
bastard, butcher; printed seditious books against her, wherein they railed at
her like hell-hounds, and named her traitorous Marie, mischievous Marie” (<i>An
oration against the unlawful insurrection of the Protestants of our time under
Pretence to reform Religion</i>, Louvain, 1565).</p></div>

A more correct opinion of this trait in her character than that expressed
by Hume, Froude and some others, is given by a writer in the <i>Dictionary of
National Biography</i> on John Heywood, the wit and epigrammatist, who says
that his fortunes were at their highest under Mary, “who had a highly cultivated
intelligence, and was fond of innocent fun ... and it is said that his
pleasantries, often acceptable in her privy chamber, helped to amuse her even
on her death-bed.”</p></div>

It has been elsewhere pointed out that Michiel did not, in the matter of
generosity, give Mary the credit she deserved. It was natural to her to be
lavishly generous, but the state of her finances was such, that parsimony became
an equivalent for honesty. This he afterwards admits.</p></div>

abducat a te. Nulli placere appetam vel displicere timeam nisi tibi.
Vilescant mihi Domine omnia transitoria, et cara mihi sint omnia tua.
Tædeat me gaudii quod est sine te, nec aliud cupiam quod est extra te.
Delectet me Domine, labor qui est pro te; et tædiosa sit mihi omnis
quies quæ est sine te. Frequenter da mihi, Domine, cor ad te dirigere,
et in defectione mea cum emendationis proposito dolendo
pensare. Fac me Domine Deus obedientem sine contradictione,
pauperem sine defectione, castum sine corruptione, patientem sine
murmuratione, humilem sine fictione, et hilarem sine dissolutione,
tristem sine dejectione, maturum sine gravitate, agilem sine levitate,
timentem te sine desperatione, veracem sine duplicitate, operantem
bona sine præsumptione, proximum corripere sine elatione, ipsum
ædificare verbo et exemplo sine simulatione. Da mihi, Domine
Deus, cor pervigil quod nulla abducat a te curiosa cogitatio: da
nobile, quod nulla deorsum trahat indigna affectio: da rectum, quod
nulla seorsum obliquet sinistra intentio: da firmum, quod nulla frangat
tribulatio: da liberum, quod nulla sibi vindicet violenta affectio.
Largire mihi, Domine Deus meus, intellectum te cognoscentem, diligentiam
te quærentem, sapientiam te invenientem, conversationem
tibi placentem, perseverantiam fidenter te expectantem, et fiduciam

<p>The prayer of Saint Thomas of Aquin, translated out of Latin
into English by the most excellent Princess Mary, daughter to the
most high and mighty Prince and Princess, King Henry the VIII.
and Queen Katharine, his wife, in the year of Our Lord God 1527
and the eleventh year of her age.</p>

<p>O merciful God, grant me to covet with an ardent mind those
things which may please Thee, to search them wisely, to know them
truly, and to fulfil them perfectly, to the laud and glory of Thy
Name. Order my living that I may do that which Thou requirest
of me, and give me grace, that I may know it, and have wit and
power to do it, and that I may obtain those things which may be
most convenient for my soul. Good Lord, make my way sure and
straight to Thee, that I fail not between prosperity and adversity,
but that in prosperous things I may give Thee thanks, and in adversity
be patient, so that I be not lift up with the one, nor oppressed
with the other, and that I may rejoice in nothing but in this which
moveth me to Thee, nor be sorry for nothing but for those which
draweth me from Thee; desiring to please nobody, nor fearing to
displease any besides Thee. Lord, let all worldly things be vile to
me, for Thee, and that all Thy things be dear to me, and Thou,
good Lord, most special above them all. Let me be weary with
that joy which is without Thee, and let me desire nothing besides
Thee. Let the labour delight me which is for Thee, and let all the
rest weary me which is not in Thee. Make me to lift my heart oft-times
to Thee, and when I fall, make me to think and be sorry, with
a steadfast purpose of amendment. My God, make me humble without
feigning, merry without lightness, sad without mistrust, sober
without dulness, fearing without despair, gentle without doubleness,
trusting in Thee without presumption, telling my neighbour’s faults
without mocking, obedient without arguing, patient without grudging,
and pure without corruption. My most loving Lord and God, give
me a waking heart, that no curious thought withdraw me from Thee.
Let it be so strong that no unworthy affection draw me backward,
so stable that no tribulation break it, and so free that no election by
violence make any change to it. My Lord God, grant me wit to
know Thee, diligence to seek Thee, wisdom to find Thee, conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>
to please Thee, continuance to look for Thee, and finally hope
to embrace Thee, by Thy penance here to be punished, and in our
way to use Thy benefits by Thy grace, and in heaven through Thy
glory to have delight in Thy joys and rewards. Amen.</p>

<p>My Lord, when your Lordship was last here, it pleased you to
say, that I should not mistrust the King’s Grace, nor your Lordship,
which word was more comfort to me than I can write, as God knoweth.
And now it boldeth me to show you my poor mind. My Lord,
when my Lady Mary’s Grace was born, it pleased the King’s Grace
to appoint me Lady Mistress, and made me a Baroness. And so I
have been a ... (mother?) to the children his Grace have had since.</p>

<p>Now it is so, my Lady Elizabeth is put from that degree she was
afore: and what degree she is at now I know not but by hearing
say; therefore I know not how to order her, nor myself, nor none of
hers that I have the rule of: that is, her women and her grooms:
beseeching you to be good Lord to my Lady and to all hers. And
that she may have some raiments; for she hath neither gown nor
kirtle, nor petticoat, nor no manner of linen for smocks, nor kerchiefs,
nor sleeves, nor rails, nor body-stychets, nor handkerchiefs, nor
mufflers, nor begens. All this her Graces Mostake, I have driven off
as long as I can, that by my troth I cannot drive it no longer:
beseeching you my Lord, that ye will see that her Grace may have
that is needful for her, as my trust is ye will do.... My Lord,
master Shelton would have my Lady Elizabeth to dine and sup
every day at the board of estate. Alas, my Lord, it is not meet for
a child of her age, to keep such rule yet. I promise you, my Lord,
I dare not take it upon me to keep her Grace in health, and she keep
that rule: for there she shall see divers meats and fruits and wine,
which would be hard for me to refrain her Grace from it. Ye know,
my Lord, there is no place of correction there. And she is yet too
young to correct greatly. I know well and she be there, I shall
neither bring her up to the King’s Grace’s honour, nor hers, nor to
her health nor my poor honesty. Wherefore I show your Lordship
this my discharge, beseeching you my Lord that my Lady may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
a mess of meat to her own lodging, with a good dish or two, that is
meet for her to eat of. And the reversion of the mess shall satisfy
all her women, a gentleman usher and a groom. Which been eleven
persons on her side. Sure I am, it will be (in to right little) as
great profit to the King’s Grace, this way as the other way. For if
all this should be set abroad, they must have three or four mess of
meat, where this one mess shall suffice them all with bread and
drink, according as my Lady Mary’s Grace had afore, and to be
ordered in all things as her Grace was afore. God knoweth, my
Lady hath great pain with her great teeth, and they come very slowly
forth: and causeth me to suffer her Grace to have her will more than
I would. I trust to God and her teeth were well graft to have her
Grace after another fashion than she is yet; so I trust, the King’s
Grace shall have great comfort in her Grace. For she is as toward a
child and as gentle of conditions as ever I knew any in my life, Jesu
preserve her Grace ... Hunsdon 1536.</p>

<p>Although my fault be such that, but for the goodness and
clemency of the queen, I can have no hope of finding pardon nor in
craving forgiveness, having given ear to those who at that time
appeared, not only to myself, but also to a great part of this realm
to be wise, and now have manifested themselves the contrary, not
only to my and their great detriment, but with the common disgrace
and blame of all, they having with such shameful boldness made so
blameable and dishonorable an attempt to give to others that which
was not theirs, neither did it become me to accept (wherefore rightly
and justly am I ashamed to ask pardon for such a crime) nevertheless,
I trust in God, that as now I know and confess my want of
prudence, for which I deserve heavy punishment, except for the very
great mercy of your majesty, I can still on many grounds conceive
hope of your infinite clemency, it being known that the error imputed
to me has not been altogether caused by myself. Because, although
my fault may be great, and I confess it to be so, nevertheless I
am charged and esteemed guilty more than I have deserved. For
whereas I might take upon me that of which I was not worthy, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
no one can ever say either that I sought it as my own, or that I
was pleased with it, or ever accepted it. For when it was publicly
reported that there was no more hope of the King’s life, as the
Duchess of Northumberland had before promised, that I should
remain in the house with my mother, so she, having understood this
soon after from her husband, who was the first that told it to me,
did not wish me to leave my house, saying to me that if God should
have willed to call the King to his mercy, of whose life there was no
lingering hope, it would be needful for me to go immediately to the
Tower, I being made by his majesty heir of his realm. Which words
being spoken to me thus unexpectedly, put me in great perturbation,
and greatly disturbed my mind, as yet soon after they oppressed
me much more. But I, nevertheless making little account of these
words, delayed to go from my mother. So that the Duchess of
Northumberland was angry with me, and with the duchess my
mother, saying that if she had resolved to keep me in the house,
she should have kept her son, my husband near her, to whom she
thought I would certainly have gone, and she would have been free
from the charge of me. And in truth, I remained in her house two
or three nights, but at length obtained leave to go to Chelsea, for
my recreation, where soon after, being sick, I was summoned by
the Council, giving me to understand that I must go that same night
to Sion to receive that which had been ordered for me by the King.
And she who brought me this news was the lady Sidney, my sister-in-law,
the daughter of the Duchess of Northumberland, who told
me with extraordinary seriousness, that it was necessary for me to go
with her, which I did. When we arrived there, we found no one,
but soon after came the Duke of Northumberland, the marquis of
Northampton, the earl of Arundel, the earl of Huntingdon, and the
earl of Pembroke. By which lords I was long held in conversation
before they announced to me the death of the King, especially by
the earls of Huntingdon and Pembroke, who, with unwonted caresses
and pleasantness, did me such reverence as was not at all suitable to
my state, kneeling down before me on the ground, and in many
other ways, making semblance of honouring me. And acknowledging
me as their sovereign lady (so that they made me blush with
infinite confusion) at length they brought to me the duchess Frances
my mother, the duchess of Northumberland, and the marchioness
of Northampton. The duke of Northumberland, as president of the
council, announced the death of King Edward, shewing afterward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
what cause we had all to rejoice for the virtuous and praiseworthy
life that he had led, as also for his very good death. Furthermore
he pretended to comfort himself and the bystanders, by praising
much his prudence and goodness, for the very great care that he had
taken of his kingdom at the very close of his life, having prayed God
to defend it from the Popish faith, and to deliver it from the rule of
his evil sisters. He then said that his Majesty had well weighed an
act of Parliament, wherein it was already resolved, that whoever should
acknowledge the most serene Mary, that is your most serene Majesty
or the Lady Elizabeth, and receive them as true heirs of the crown
of England should be had all for traitors, one of them having been
formerly disobedient to her father Henry the 8th, and also to himself,
concerning the truth of religion, and afterwards also capital
enemies of the Word of God, and both bastards. Wherefore, in no
manner did he wish that they should be heirs of him, and of that
crown, he being able in every way to disinherit them. And therefore,
before his death, he gave order to the council that, for the honour
they owed to him, and for the love they bare to the realm, and for
the affection that was due to their country, they should obey this
his last will. The Duke then added, that I was the heir named by
his Majesty, to succeed to the crown, and that my sisters should
likewise succeed me, in case of my default of issue. At which words,
all the lords of the council kneeled down before me, telling me that
they rendered to me the honour that was due to my person, I being
of true direct lineage heir to that crown, and that it became them, in
the best manner, to observe that which, with deliberate mind, they
had promised to the King, even to shed their blood, exposing their
own lives to death. Which things as soon as I had heard, with infinite
grief of mind, how I was beside myself stupefied and troubled,
I will leave it to those lords who were present to testify, who saw
me, overcome by sudden and unexpected grief, fall on the ground,
weeping very bitterly; and then, declaring to them my insufficiency,
I greatly bewailed myself for the death of so noble a prince, and at
the same time, turned myself to God, humbly praying and beseeching
him, that if what was given to me was rightly and lawfully mine, his
divine Majesty would grant me such grace and spirit that I might
govern it to his glory and service, and to the advantage of this
realm. On the day following (as is known to every one) I was
conducted to the Tower, and shortly afterwards were presented to
me by the Marquis of Winchester, lord high treasurer, the jewels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
with which he also brought me the crown, although it had never
been demanded from him by me, or by any one in my name; and
he further wished me to put it on my head, to try whether it really
became me well or no. The which, although with many excuses I
refused to do, he nevertheless added, that I might take it without
fear, and that another also should be made, to crown my husband
with me. Which thing, I, for my part, heard truly with a troubled
mind, and with ill will, even with infinite grief and displeasure of
heart. And after the said lord was gone, and I was reasoning of
many things with my husband, he assented, that if he were to be
made King, he would be made so by me, by act of parliament. But
afterwards I sent for the earls of Arundel and Pembroke, and said
to them that if the crown belonged to me, I should be content to
make my husband a duke, but would never consent to make him
king. Which resolution of mine gave his mother (this my opinion
being related to her) great cause for anger and disdain, so that she,
being very angry with me, and greatly displeased, persuaded her son
not to sleep with me any longer as he was wont to do, affirming to
me moreover that he did not wish in any wise to be a duke, but a
king. So that I was constrained to send to him the earls of Arundel
and Pembroke, who had negotiated with him to come from me,
otherwise I knew, that the next morning he would have gone to
Sion. And thus in truth was I deceived by the duke and the council
and ill-treated by my husband and his mother. Moreover (as Sir
John Gates has confessed) he (the duke) was the first to persuade
King Edward to make me his heir. As to the rest, for my part, I
know not what the council had determined to do, but I know for
certain that, twice during this time, poison was given to me, first in
the house of the duchess of Northumberland, and afterwards here in
the Tower, as I have the best and most certain testimony, besides
that since that time all my hair has fallen off, and all these things
I have wished to say, for the witness of my innocence, and the disburdening
of my conscience.</p>

<p>The last of September Queen Mary rode through the city of
London towards Westminster, sitting in a chariot of cloth of tissue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
drawn with six horses and trapped with the like cloth of tissue. She
sat in a gown of purple velvet furred with powdered ermine, having
on her head a caul of cloth of tinsel beset with pearl and stone,
and above the same upon her head, a round circlet of gold beset so
richly with precious stones, that the value thereof was inestimable,
the same caul and circlet being so massy and ponderous, that she
was fain to bear up her head with her hand, and the canopy was
borne over her chariot. Before her rode a number of gentlemen
and knights, then judges, then doctors, then bishops, then lords,
then the Council, after whom followed the Knights of the Bath,
thirteen in number, in their robes, the bishop of Winchester, Lord
Chancellor, and the Marquess of Winchester, Lord High Treasurer;
next came the Duke of Norfolk, and after him the Earl of Oxford
who bare the sword before her, the Mayor of London in a gown
of crimson velvet bare the sceptre of gold, etc., after the Queen’s
Chariot, Sir Edward Hastings led her horse in his hand: then came
another chariot, having a covering all of cloth of silver, all white,
and six horses trapped with the like. Therein sate the Lady
Elizabeth and the lady Anne of Cleves, then ladies and gentlemen
riding on horses trapped with red velvet, and their gowns and kirtles
likewise of red velvet: after them followed two other chariots
covered with red satin, and the horses be trapped with the same, and
certain gentlewomen between every of the said chariots, riding in
crimson satin, their horses betrapped with the same, the number
of the gentlewomen so riding were forty-six, besides them in the
chariots. At Fenchurch was a costly pageant made by the Genoese;
at Gracechurch corner there was another pageant made by the
Easterlings. At the upper end of Grace Street, there was another
pageant made by the Florentines, very high, on the top whereof there
stood four pictures, and in the midst of them and most highest,
there stood an angel all in green with a trumpet in his hand, and
when the trumpeter who stood secretly in the pageant did sound
his trump, the angel did put his trump to his mouth, as though
it had been the same that had sounded, to the great marvelling
of many ignorant persons. This pageant was made with three
thoroughfares or gates, &amp;c. The Conduit in Cornhill ran wine, and
beneath the Conduit, a pageant made at the charges of the City, and
another at the great Conduit in Cheap, and a fountain by it running
wine. The standard in Cheap new painted, with the waits of the
City aloft thereof playing. The Cross in Cheap new washed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
burnished. One other pageant at the little Conduit in Cheap next
to Paul’s made by the City, where the Aldermen stood. And when
the Queen came against them, the Recorder made a short proposition
to her, and then the Chamberlain presented to her in the
name of the Mayor and the City, a purse of cloth of gold and 1,000
marks of gold in it. Then she rode forth, and in Paul’s Churchyard
against the School, one Master Haywood sate in a pageant
under a vine, and made to her an oration in Latin and English.
Then was there one Peter a Dutchman stood on the weather-cock
of Paul’s steeple, holding a streamer in his hand of five yards long,
and waving thereof stood some time on the one foot and shook the
other, and then kneeled on his knees, to the great marvel of all
people. He had made two scaffolds under him, one above the
Cross, having torches and streamers set on it, and one other over
the bole of the Cross, likewise set with streamers and torches, which
could not burn, the wind being so great. The said Peter had sixteen
pounds thirteen shillings and four pence given him by the City
for his costs and pains, and all his stuff. Then was there a pageant
made against the Dean of Paul’s gate, where the choristers of Paul’s
played on vials, and sung. Ludgate was newly repaired, painted and
richly hanged, with minstrels playing and singing there. Then was
there another pageant at the Conduit in Fleet Street, and the
Temple Bar was newly painted and hanged. And thus she passed
to Whitehall at Westminster, where she took her leave of the Lord
Mayor, giving him great thanks for his pains, and the City for their
cost. On the morrow, which was the first day of October, the Queen
went by water to the old palace, and there remained till about eleven
of the clock, and then went on foot upon blue cloth, being railed
on either side unto Saint Peter’s Church, where she was solemnly
crowned and anointed by the Bishop of Winchester, which coronation
and other ceremonies and solemnities then used according to
the old custom, was not fully ended till it was nigh four of the clock
at night, that she returned from the church, before whom was then
borne three swords sheathed and one naked. The great service that
day done in Westminster Hall at dinner by divers noblemen would
ask long time to write. The Lord Mayor of London and twelve
citizens kept the high cupboard of plate as butlers, and the Queen
gave to the Mayor for his fee, a cup of gold with a cover weighing
seventeen ounces.</p>

<p class="hanging">OPINION OF THE MOST SERENE QUEEN OF ENGLAND WHICH
SHE WROTE WITH HER OWN HAND, AND GAVE TO HIS
RIGHT REVEREND LORDSHIP THE LEGATE, CARDINAL
POLE, AT THE TIME WHEN THE SYNOD WAS HELD.<a name="FNanchor_728_728"
id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>First—I should wish that all the Church property, which for the
discharge of our conscience, the King my husband and I have totally
renounced, should be distributed as shall seem best to my Lord Cardinal
and to the rest of you, so that what has been commenced for
the increase of the religion in this kingdom, may produce its due
effect.</p>

<p>Secondly—I desire, that the preachers by their piety and doctrine
do smother and extinguish all those errors and false opinions disseminated
and spread abroad by the late preachers, making provision at the
same time, that no book be printed sold or purchased, or brought into
the kingdom, without our licence, and under very strict penalties.</p>

<p>Thirdly—I should deem it well, for the churches and universities
of this kingdom, to be visited by such persons as my Lord
Cardinal and we may know to be fit and sufficient, to execute what
is required in this matter.</p>

<p>Fourthly—Touching the punishment of heretics, I believe it
would be well to inflict punishment at this beginning, without much
cruelty or passion, but without however omitting to do such justice
on those who choose by their false doctrines to deceive simple
persons, that the people may clearly comprehend that they have not
been condemned without just cause, whereby others will be brought
to know the truth, and will beware of letting themselves be induced
to relapse into such new and false opinions. And above all, I should
wish that no one be burned in London, save in the presence of some
member of the Council; and that during such executions, both here
and elsewhere, some good and pious sermons be preached, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Fifthly—I really believe it to be by no means fitting, for a
plurality of benefices to be placed in the hands of one individual,
but that they should be so distributed that each priest may be
resident, and have care of his flock, whereas at present, quite the
reverse is seen, to which I attribute so great a lack of preachers
throughout this kingdom; nor are they of such a sort as they ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
to be, so as by their doctrine to overcome the diligence of false
preachers in the time of schism, and also by leading an exemplary
life, without which in my opinion, their sermons would not be of
so much profit as I could wish; and in like manner, as their good
example will through them, effect great good, so I acknowledge myself
to be very greatly bound on my part also to give the like example by
aiding in the disposition and maintenance of such persons, that they
may perform their office and duty well; not forgetting on the other
hand, to have those punished who shall do the contrary, that it may
serve as a very evident example to the whole of this kingdom, of how
I discharge my conscience in this matter, and administer justice by
doing so.</p>

<i>magistrate</i> has this right, is using an inadequate word: it is the
society for which the magistrate is agent. He may be morally
or theologically wrong in restraining the propagation of opinions
which he thinks dangerous, but he is politically right.” <i>Mayo</i>—“I
am of opinion, Sir, that every man is entitled to liberty of
conscience in religion; and that the magistrate cannot restrain that
right.” <i>Johnson</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>—“Sir, I
 agree with you. Every man has a right to
liberty of conscience, and with that the magistrate cannot interfere.
People confound liberty of thinking with liberty of talking, nay, with
liberty of preaching. Every man has a physical right to think as he
pleases; for it cannot be discovered how he thinks. He has not a
moral right, for he ought to inform himself and think justly. But,
Sir, no member of a society has a right to <i>teach</i> any doctrine contrary
to what the society holds to be true. The magistrate, I say,
may be wrong in what he thinks: but while he thinks himself right,
he may and ought to enforce what he thinks....” <i>Goldsmith</i>—”...
Our first reformers, who were burnt for not believing bread
and wine to be Christ——” <i>Johnson</i> (interrupting him)—“Sir, they
were not burnt for not believing bread and wine to be Christ, but for
insulting those who did believe it. And, Sir, when the first reformers
began, they did not intend to be martyred: as many of them ran away
as could....” <i>Mayo</i>—“But, Sir, is it not very hard that I should
not be allowed to teach my children what I really believe to be the
truth?” <i>Johnson</i>—“Why, Sir, you might contrive to teach your
children <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">extra scandalum</span></i>;
but, Sir, the magistrate, if he knows it
has a right to restrain you. Suppose you teach your children to be
thieves?” <i>Mayo</i>—“This is making a joke of the subject.” <i>Johnson</i>—“Nay,
Sir, take it thus:—that you teach them the community of
goods; for which there are as many plausible arguments as for most
erroneous doctrines. You teach them that all things at first were in
common, and that no man had a right to anything, but as he laid
his hands upon it; and that this still is, or ought to be the rule
amongst mankind. Here, Sir, you sap a great principle in society—property,
and don’t you think the magistrate would have a right to
prevent you? or suppose you should teach your children the notion
of the Adamites, and they should run naked into the streets, would
not the magistrate have a right to flog ’em into their doublets?”
<i>Mayo</i>—“I think the magistrate has no right to interfere till there is
some overt act.” <i>Boswell</i>—“So, Sir, though he sees an enemy to
the state charging a blunderbuss, he is not to interfere till it is fired
off!” <i>Mayo</i>—“He must be sure of its direction against the state.”
<i>Johnson</i>—“The magistrate is to judge of that. He has no right to
restrain your thinking, because the evil centres in yourself. If a
man were sitting at this table, chopping off his fingers, the magistrate,
as guardian of the community, has no authority to restrain him,
however he might do it from kindness as a parent—though, indeed,
upon more consideration, I think he may; as it is probable that he
who is chopping off his own fingers, may soon proceed to chop off
those of other people. If I think it right to steal Mr. Dilly’s plate
I am a bad man; but he can say nothing to me. If I make an open
declaration that I think so, he will keep me out of his house. If I
put forth my hand, I shall be sent to Newgate. This is the gradation
of thinking, preaching and acting: if a man thinks erroneously he
may keep his thoughts to himself, and nobody will trouble him; if
he preaches erroneous doctrine, society may expel him; if he acts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
in consequence of it, the law takes place and he is hanged.” <i>Mayo</i>—“But,
Sir, ought not Christians to have liberty of conscience?”
<i>Johnson</i>—“I have already told you so, Sir. You are coming back
to where you were.” <i>Boswell</i>—“Dr. Mayo is always taking a return
postchaise, and going the stage over again. He has it at half-price.”
<i>Johnson</i>—“Dr. Mayo, like other champions for unlimited toleration
has got a set of words. Sir, it is no matter, politically, whether the
magistrate be right or wrong. Suppose a club were to be formed
to drink confusion to King George the Third, and a happy restoration
to Charles the Third, this would be very bad with respect to the
state; but every member of that club must either conform to its
rules, or be turned out of it. Old Baxter, I remember, maintains,
that the magistrates should ‘tolerate all things that are tolerable’.
This is no good definition of toleration upon any principle; but it
shows that he thought some things were not tolerable.” <i>Toplady</i>—“Sir,
you have untwisted this difficult subject with great dexterity.”</p>

<p>Cobbett’s <i>History of the Reformation</i>, which raised a storm of
abuse at the time of its publication, may not in these days be ignored
by any writer on the subject. Its statements, nearly all based on
Lingard, who is admittedly a fair and large-minded authority, have
been found to contain far less exaggeration than was formerly supposed.
Cobbett lived and died a Protestant, but his convictions did
not bias him concerning the seditious practices of Foxe’s Martyrs.
He says:<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730"
class="fnanchor">[730]</a>—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span></p>
<p>“The real truth about these ‘Martyrs’ is that they were generally
a set of most wicked wretches, who sought to destroy the Queen
and her government, and under the pretence of conscience and
superior piety, to obtain the means of again preying upon the people.
No mild means could reclaim them; those means had been tried:
the Queen had to employ vigorous means, or to suffer her people to
continue to be torn by the religious factions, created not by her, but
by her two immediate predecessors, who had been aided and abetted
by many of those who now were punished, and who were worthy of ten
thousand deaths each, if ten thousand deaths could have been endured.
They were, without a single exception, apostates, perjurers or
plunderers; and the greater part of them had also been guilty of
flagrant high treason against Mary herself, who had spared their lives,
but whose lenity they had requited by every effort within their power
to overset her authority and government. To make particular mention
of all the ruffians that perished upon this occasion would be a
task as irksome as it would be useless; but there were amongst them
three of Cranmer’s bishops and himself! For now, justice at last
overtook this most mischievous of all villains, who had justly to go
to the same stake that he had unjustly caused so many others to be
tied to; the three others were Hooper, Latimer and Ridley, each of
whom was indeed inferior in villainy to Cranmer, but to few other
men that have ever existed!”</p>

And whereas I have by my warrant under my Signe Manuell assigned

yerly valewe of 200<sup>li</sup> and somewhat more to be assur’d unto the
Master and Brotherne of the Hospitall of Savoy, fyrste erected and

forasmuch as presently there ys no howse or hospitall specyally ordeyn’d
and provyded for the relefe and helpe of pore and old Soldiers,
and namely of such as have been or shall be hurt or maymed in the
warres and servys of this Realme, the which we thynke both honour,
conscyence and charyte willeth should be provided for. And therefore
my mynde and wyll ys, that my Executors shall, as shortly as

shall have 30 pownds by the yere, and ether of the said two brotherne
20<sup>li</sup> by the yere, and the rest of the revenewe of the said londs, I
will that my Executors shall limyt and appoynt by good ordynances
and statuts, to be made and stablyshed upon the erection of the
said Hospitall, how the same shall be us’d and imployed, wherein
specyally I would have them respect the relefe succour and helpe
of pore, impotent and aged Souldiers, and chefely those that be
fallen into exstreme poverte, havyng no pencyon or other pretence of
lyvyng, or are become hurt or maym’d in the warres of this Realme,
or in onny servyce for the defence and suerte of ther Prince and of
ther Countrey, or of the Domynions thereunto belongyng. Also I
will and specyally charge the executors of this my present testament
and last Will, that yf I have injuried or done wrong to onny person
(as to my remembrance willingly I have not) yet yf onny such may
be proved, and lykewyse all such detts as I owe to onny person sens
the tyme I have been Quene of this Realme, and specyally the lone
money (the which diverse of my lovyng subjects have lately advanced
and lent unto me) that the same injuries (yf onny be) and the said
detts and lone money above all thyngs, as shortly as may be after my
decesse be recompenced, restor’d and pay’d, and that doon, my
mynde and will ys, that all such detts as were owing by my late
Father, King Henry 8<sup>th</sup> or by my late brother K. Edward the 6<sup>th</sup>,
shall likewyse, as they conveniently may, be satisfyed and payd.
And for as much as yt hath pleased Almighty God of hys infenyte
marcye &amp; goodnesse, to reduce this Realme unto the unyte of
Christ’s Church, from the which yt declyned, and during the tyme
thereof diverse londes and other hereditaments, goods and possessions
geven and dispos’d, as well by sondry of my Progenitors as by
other good and vertuous people to sondrye places and Monasteries
of Religion, and to other Ecclesiastical howses and persons, for the
mayntenance of Godds servyce, and for continuall prayer to be made
for the relefe both of the lyvyng and of the dedde, were taken away
and committed to other uses; I have before this tyme thought yt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
good, for some part of satisfaction thereof, and to be a piece of the
dewtie I owe unto God, that some porcyon of the londs and hereditaments
that were sometyme the goods of the said Church shold be
restor’d ageyne unto good and Godly uses, and for the accomplyshing
thereof I have, with the consent of my said most Dere Lord and
Husband the Kyng’s Majesty, and by theauthority of Parliament, and
with the advyce and counsell of the Most Rev. Father in God and
my right intierly beloved Cousyne Cardynall Poole, Archbp̃. of Cant.
and Primate of Englond, who hath specyally travelled as a good
Mynister and Legate sent from the Apostolique See to reduce this
Realme unto the Unyte of the said See, Renounc’d and geven over
as well diverse parsonages Impropriate, tythes and other Spirituall
hereditaments, as also divers other profits and hereditaments some
tyme belongyng to the said Ecclesiasticall and Spirituall persons
and howses of Religion, to be ordered, used and imploy’d by the
said most Reverend Father in God, in such manner and forme
as ys prescribed and lymitted by the said Statute, and as to hys
godly wysdome shall be thowght mete and convenyent. My mynde,
will and pleasure ys, that such ordynances and devyses as the
said most Rev<sup>d</sup> Father in God hath made and devised, or shall
hereafter make and devise, for and concerning the said parsonages,
tithes and other Spirituall hereditaments (the which I have committed
to his order and disposition) shall be inviolably observ’d.
Requyryng my said Cousyne and most Rev<sup>d</sup> Father in God, as he
hath begun a good work in this Realme, soe he will (cheifly for
God’s sake and glory, and for the good will he beareth unto me, and
to this my Realme, beynge his native Countrey) doe, as much as he
maye, by Godd’s grace, to fynishe the same. And specyally to
dispose and order the said Parsonages, tithes, and other Spirituall
possessions and hereditaments commytted to his order, with as much
speed as he convenyently may, accordynge to the trust and confidence
that my most Dere Lord and Husband and I, and the whole
Realme have repos’d in hym, and yn hys virtue and wysdome, for
the which God shall rewarde hym, and this hys Countrey honour
and love hym. And for hys better assistance in theexecution
thereof, I will, charge and requyre my Executors, and all others of
my Counsell, and the rest of my good and faythfull Subjects, that
they to the uttermost of ther power be aydynge and assistynge unto
my said Cousyne, as they tender the benefit of ther Countrey and
ther own Commodyte. Furthermore I will and charge my said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
Executors, that yf onny person or persons have pay’d unto my use
onny Summe of money for the purchase of onny londs, tenements
and hereditaments the assurances whereof to them in my lyfe tyme
ys not perfitted, that the said Person or Persons be, within such short
tyme after my decesse as may be, either repay’d ther mony, or else
have good assurances of the said londs, or of others of the like
valewe, made unto them accordynge to the laws of this Realme.
Also I will that my Executors shall within oon quarter of a year
next after my decesse, destribute amongst my pore Servants that be
ordinary, and have most nede, the Summe of 2000<sup>li</sup>. willyng them in
the destribution thereof to have a specyall regarde unto such as have
serv’d me longest and have no certainty of lyvyng of my gifte to
lyve by after my decesse. And as towchyng the dispocyon of this
my Imperiall Crowne of England, and the Crowne of Ireland, with
my title to France, and all the dependances, of the same, whereof
by the mere provydence of Almighty God I am the lawful Inheritor

also desyryng them (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per viscera Misericordiæ Dei</span>)

care and stodie hath ben, and chefely ys, to reduce this

ben of, and to conserve the same therein; And not dowting but

gracious disposition towards them and this Realme. And for as
much as I have no Legacy or jewell that I covet more to leve unto
hys Majesty to reqyte the nobility of hys harte towards me and
this Realme, nor he more desirous to have, than the love of my
Subjects, I doe therefore once agayne reqyre them to bere and owe
unto his Highnesse the same dewtie and love that they naturally doe
and should owe unto me, and in hope they will not forget the same,
I do specyally recommend the same dewtye and love unto hys
Highnesse, as a legacye, the which I trust he shall enjoye. Also I
will and geve unto my said issewe all my jewells, ships, municyons of
warre, and artillery, and after my detts (and the detts of my said late
Father and brother, King Henry 8. and King Edward 6.) satisfied
and pay’d, and this my present testament and last will perform’d, I

Remembrance the good and dewtyfull service to me doon by diverse

<p>Fyrste, whereas I the said Quene have with the good contentment
and pleasure of my said most dere belov’d Lorde and husbande
the Kyng’s Majesty devis’d &amp; made my said last will and testament,
beryng date the 30<sup>th</sup> day of Marche last past, and by the same, for
that as I then thowght myself to be with childe did devise and
dispose the Imperiall Crowne of this Realme of Englond and the
Crowne of Ireland, with my title to France and all the dependances
thereof, and all other honours, Castells, Fortresses, Prerogatives and

<p>Forasmuch as God hath hitherto sent me no frewte nor heire of my

onny or noo, Therefore both for the discharge of my conscyence and
dewtie towards God and this Realme, and for the better satisfaction
of all good people, and to thentent my said last will and Testament
(the which I trust, is agreeable to God’s law and to the laws of this
Realme) may be dewly performed, and my dettes (pryncipally those
I owe to many of my good subjects, and the which they most lovyngly
lent unto me) trewly and justly answered and payed, I have thought

this unto my said testament and last will, viz. Yf yt shall please
Almighty God to call me to his mercye owte of this transytory lyfe
without issewe and heire of my bodye lawfully begotten, Then I most
instantly desire et per viscera misericordiæ Dei, requyre my next

only to permytt and suffer theexecutors of my said Testament and

such assurance and conveyance as the Law requyreth for the State
of the londs which I have devysed and appoynted to the howses of
Religion, and to the Savoye, and to the Hospitall I would have
erected, be not suffycyent and good in Lawe by my said Will, then I
most hertily also requyre both for God’s sake, and for the honour
and love my said heyre and Successour bereth unto me, that my said
heyre and Successour will supplye the Imperfection of my said will
and testament therein, &amp; accomplyshe and fynishe the same

<p class="p2 hanging">A PRAYER OF THE LADY MARY TO THE LORD JESU;
AGAINST THE ASSAULTS OF VICES.</p>

<p>Most benign Lord Jesu! Behold me wretched beggar, and
most vile sinner, prostrate here before the feet of thy mercy. Behold
the wounds, sores, griefs and vices of my soul, (which alas!
I have brought into the same by sin) that they may be healed.
Most Merciful Lord Jesu! Have pity upon mine infirmities, captivity
and infelicity: by means whereof my miserable soul is pressed
down to earthly things, and divided into sundry desires.</p>

<p>Most loving Jesu! I beseech thee for thy great love’s sake, which
caused thee to deliver thy soul into the hands of sinners, to be bound
and crucified; and which also did force thee to remain three hours
upon the cross, more than the nails either of thy hands or feet had
power to do. For thy charity I humbly desire thee to loose the yoke
of my captivity, and to deliver me from all my vices, concupiscence,
and evil inclinations, to defend me from all the assaults of mine
enemies, and in time of temptation to help me. Moreover, quench
and pluck up by the roots in me all private love, all inordinate
motions, passions and affections, all provokings, readiness and
inclination to pride, wrath, envy and vainglory, with such other
like. For it is in thy power only to deliver me from these things.
Sweet Jesu! Fulfil me with thy grace, and most perfect charity.
Make me to continue in goodness, that I may eschew all occasion
of sin, strongly overcome temptation, subdue the flesh to the Spirit,
persecute and banish sin, and obey thy inspiration; escape the
deceits and frauds of the Devil, never consent to any sin, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
nourish anything that should displease thee. But cause me most
fervently to thirst for thy honour, laud and glory, most faithfully to
prefer the same, and to give and submit myself wholly to thy will.
My Lord God, give me grace to cleave to thee only with a clean
and pure heart, that I may be unite and knit to thee without separation
by a most chaste and fervent love. Amen.</p>


<p class="p2 hanging">A MEDITATION TOUCHING ADVERSITY, MADE BY MY LADY
MARY’S GRACE, 1549.</p>

<p>This natural life of ours is but a pilgrimage from this wandring
world, and exile from our own country: that is to say, a way from all
misery to thee (Lord) which art our whole felicity. And lest the
pleasantness and commodity of this life should withdraw us from the
going to the right and speedy way to thee, thou dost stir and provoke
us forward, and as yet ward prick us with thornes, to the intent we
should covet a quiet rest, and end of our journey. Therefore sickness,
weepings, sorrow, mourning, and in conclusion all adversities
be unto us as spurs; with the which we being dull horses, or rather
very asses, are forced not to remain long in this transitory way.
Wherefore Lord, give us grace to forget this wayfaring journey, and
to remember our proper and true country. And if thou do add a
weight of adversity, add thereunto strength, that we shall not be
overcome with that burden: but having our minds continually erected
and lift up to thee, we may be able strongly to bear it. Lord! all
things be thine; therefore do with all things without any exception
as shall seem convenient to thine unsearchable wisdom. And give
us grace never to will but as thou wilt. So be it.</p>


<p class="p2 ac noindent">A PRAYER TO BE READ AT THE HOUR OF DEATH.</p>

<p>O Lord Jesu! which art the health of all men living, and the everlasting
life of them which die in faith, I, wretched sinner give and
submit myself wholly unto thy most blessed will. And I being sure
that the thing cannot perish which is committed unto thy mercy,
willingly now I leave this frail and wicked flesh, in hope of the
resurrection; which in better wise shall restore it to me again. I
beseech thee most merciful Lord Jesus Christ, that thou wilt by thy
grace make strong my soul against all temptations; and that thou
wilt cover and defend me with the buckler of thy mercy against
all the assaults of the Devil. I see and knowledge that there is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
myself no help of salvation, but all my confidence, hope and trust is
in thy most merciful goodness. I have no merits nor good works
which I may allege before thee. Of sins and evil works (alas), I see
a great heap; but through thy mercy I trust to be in the number of
them to whom thou wilt not impute their sins; but take and accept
me for righteous and just, and to be an inheritor of everlasting life.</p>

<p>Thou merciful Lord, wert born for my sake. Thou didst suffer
both hunger and thirst for my sake. Thou didst preach and teach,
thou didst pray and fast for my sake. Thou didst all good works
and deeds for my sake. Thou sufferedst most grievous pains and
torments for my sake. And finally, Thou gavest thy most precious
body to die, and thy blood to be shed on the cross for my sake.</p>

<p>Now, most merciful Saviour, let all these things profit me which
thou freely hast given me, that hast given thyself for me. Let thy
blood cleanse and wash away the spots and foulness of my sins.
Let Thy righteousness hide and cover my unrighteousness. Let
the merits of thy passion and blood be the satisfaction for my sins.</p>

<p>Give me, Lord, thy grace, that my faith, and salvation in thy blood
waver not in me, but ever be firm and constant; that the hope of
thy mercy and life everlasting never decay in me; that charity wax
not cold in me.</p>

<p>Finally, that the weakness of my flesh be not overcome by the
fear of death. Grant me merciful Father, that when Death has shut
up the eyes of my body, yet that the eyes of my soul may still behold
and look upon thee; that when death hath taken away the use of
my tongue and speech, yet that my heart may cry and say unto Thee
<i>In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum</i>; that is, O Lord,
into thy hands I give and commit my soul. <i>Domine Jesu accipe
spiritum meum.</i> Lord Jesu, receive my soul unto thee.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
